# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #2
## Despite what NumbersUSA says, immigration is a powerful force for combatting world poverty.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** NumbersUSA uses gumballs to suggest that immigration into the U.S. can't have much of an effect on world poverty. This ignores illegal immigration, the powerful effects of remittances, and the 
possibility of increased immigration.

### The Analogy

### Dissolving the Analogy (a How-To)

Restrictionist and nativist talking points have always relied on some popular, but questionable metaphors, from "A nation is like a house" to "Our lifeboat is about to capsize", and even "get in line!"

There are two important steps I like to take when dissolving an analogy.
#### 1. Point out the relevant distinction (or distinctions) that make the analogy a bad fit.
#### 2. Prove the relevance of the distinctions by saying that if they were resolved, you would agree with the analogy.

### Dissolving the Analogy: The Distinctions

#### 1. Including secondary effects (like remittances) vastly multiplies the positive effects of immigration.

The most important flaw in Mr. Beck's analogy is that it ignores the secondary effects of immigration, most importantly 'remittances'. Remittances
are the payments sent by foreign workers in the U.S. back to families that have remained behind in foreign countries. Around 100 million 
people in the world rely chiefly on remittances from the U.S. as their source of income [cite this]. If the U.S. loosened it's restrictions, it seems likely that 


#### 2. NumbersUSA ignores illegal immigration.

#### 3. Why not allow... more immigration?


### Dissolving the Analogy: The Proof

So let's make the analogy fit reality a little more.
Imagine if instead of dropping only one gumball's worth of poverty into America, Mr. Beck included illegal immigration, and foresaw a future where the U.S., say, doubled the number of visas available.
For our purposes, let's round this off to only three million a year (so, three gumballs in the tank).

But now for the real twist: after ten years of increased immigration into the U.S., let's say that the number of households recieving remittances from the U.S. would double, to 200 million.
Now Mr. Beck's tubes would show a very different story, with 30 or so gumballs taken from poverty over those ten years, and 200 gumballs being pulled out of poverty, thanks to free movement within the U.S.
