# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #2
## Despite what NumbersUSA says, immigration is a powerful force for combatting world poverty.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** NumbersUSA uses gumballs to suggest that immigration into the U.S. can't have much of an effect on world poverty. This ignores illegal immigration, the powerful effects of remittances, and the 
possibility of increased immigration.

### The Analogy

### Dissolving the Analogy (a How-To)

Restrictionist and nativist talking points have always relied on some popular, but questionable metaphors, from "A nation is like a house" to "Our lifeboat is about to capsize", and even "get in line!"

As I've mentioned elsewhere, I like to follow a three-step pattern when dissolving an analogy:
#### 1. Clarify the analogy.
#### 1. Point out the relevant distinction (or distinctions) that make the analogy a bad fit.
#### 2. Prove the relevance of the distinctions by saying that if they were resolved, I would agree with the analogy.

Let's apply this method to Beck's gumball analogy!

### Dissolving the Analogy: The Distinctions

#### 1. Beck's gumballs have no positive secondary effects, but in the real world, the secondary effects of immigration have a tremendous positive impact.

The most important flaw in Mr. Beck's analogy is that it ignores the secondary effects of immigration, most importantly 'remittances'. Remittances
are the payments sent by foreign workers in the U.S. back to families that have remained behind in foreign countries. Around 100 million 
people in the world rely chiefly on remittances from the U.S. as their source of income [cite this]. If the U.S. loosened it's restrictions, it seems likely that 


#### 2. Beck's gumballs have only one possible tube to transfer to, but in actuality there are many nations where people want to immigrate.

When Beck gave this presentation, he would always put it in the simple terms of comparing the entire world's population increase with the small number of people accepted for immigration to the United States. Beck asks, what can one single nation do in the face of an additional fifty million poor people added to the world each year?

Suspicious minds might notice that, put in this light, almost all actions of the United States are insignificant. Foreign aid, military protection, educational programs, counter-terrorism efforts... none of these have much impact if we assume that the United States is the one and only actor taking on these problems.

But of course, this isn't the case. The U.S. is not the only country capable of taking in immigrants: the combined countries of the E.U. take in an enourmous number of immigrants between themselves (i.e., within the Schengen Area), and rival the U.S. for number of immigrants taken into the E.U. from external countries. The B.R.I.C.S. countries either already do take in immigrants, or could theoretically allow much more immigration than they currently do. Add all these up, and the number of immigrants able to escape impoverished countries swells from one tiny gumball to dozens of them. "Immigration to the United States" may not be able to solve all the worlds problems, but "Many nations having open borders" might be the greatest anti-poverty movement the world has ever known. [Quote about the dramatic impact of increasing immigration.]


#### 3. Beck limits his gumball flow to only one gumball per year, but in the real world, more immigration to the U.S. (a) currently happens and (b) could happen.

Beck makes a great show of the U.S. allowing only a single gumball 'into the nation' each year, but if we are including illegal immigration, this should be closer to two "gumballs" (i.e., two million immigrants whose lives are dramatically improved). A moderate loosening of immigration restrictions could raise this number to four or five gumballs per year. Still far less than than the compared fifty gumballs 'born' into the world... but a tremendous improvement in human well-being nonetheless. Simply allowing these five million per year to immigrate to the U.S. would improve the impact of U.S. immigration policy far beyond where it currently sits in stagnation.

At it's face value, Beck's analogy seems to straightforwardly agree with the expansionist position: U.S. immigration is currently severely restricted, and the world would be a much better place if it were expanded.

#### 4.


### Dissolving the Analogy: The Proof

So let's make the analogy fit reality a little more.
Imagine if instead of dropping only one gumball's worth of poverty into America, Mr. Beck included illegal immigration, and foresaw a future where the U.S., say, doubled the number of visas available.
For our purposes, let's round this off to only five million a year (so, five gumballs in the tank).

But now for the real twist: after ten years of increased immigration into the U.S., let's say that the number of households recieving remittances from the U.S. would double, to 200 million.
Now Mr. Beck's tubes would show a very different story, with fifty or so gumballs taken from poverty over those ten years, and 200 gumballs being pulled out of poverty, thanks to free movement into the U.S. This is not an insignificant number.

### Conclusion

Mr. Beck's gumball analogy is a non-starter that ignores the basic facts of immigration. U.S. immigration policy has the potential to be one of the greatest anti-poverty tools the world has ever seen, directly raising tens of millions of people out of poverty. This would even be a much cheaper way of having this positive impact than encouraging donations to overseas causes. In other words, to create a much better world, we don't even have to convince our fellow citizens to be self-sacrificing... only to be less punishing towards people who wish to live within a hundred miles of them.

U.S. immigration policy has a tremendous impact on the well-being of our fellow humans. It could have an even larger impact, were it not for the efforts of restrictionists, like Mr. Beck.
