# The Predictions of Doom that didn't Lower the Boom
## Some restrictionist claims about the future have been pretty accurate.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** I've already written two blog posts about highly questionable predictions from people who want to restrict immigration, 
but to be intellectually honest I should also point out the projections that were right. The catch is that, although many of these projections
turned out to be accurate, they never brought the complete catastrophe that restrictionists said would happen.
