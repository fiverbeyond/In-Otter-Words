# [X] Examples of How Restrictionists Target Native-Born U.S. Citizens
## 

>**_The Short Stuff:_** 


Like other historical efforts to cleanly divide populations into "us" and "them", 

I already know from experience that it's too high a bar to hope that restrictionists would want to include naturalized U.S. citizens, but it turns out that the 
standards must be lowered even further. Make no mistake; restrictionist will firmly place native-born United States citizens into the out-group, if they are 'close enough' to the idea of immigration. 
For restrictionists, whether you count as a member of the American protect depends not just on where you were born, but also where your parents were born. This is a repeated pattern, made 
clear through a wide variety of examples. 

Here are six of them.



## 1 Listing native-born murdererers in collections of violent immigrant criminals

Many restrictionists make a disgusting habit of gathering up lists of violent crimes committed by immigrants. They collect them from police reports, or ask
poeple online to submit any stories they find. Sometimes, to keep up the idea that they are "only against illegal immigration, not all
immigration", they'll limit their list to unauthorized immigrants. But Al Perrotta and John Zmirak have no such limitations.

In their restrictionist book, John Zmirak and Al Perrotta list the 2016 Pulse nightclub mass shooting as an example of immigrant terrorism.[^orlando-shooting] 
This shooting was committed by Omar Mateen, who was a native-born United States citizen. The fact that his parents were immigrants was enough for the authors to 
include him on the list. For the authors, the dirtiness of immigration is carried down to the children.

Lest we think this was just an embarassing one-off mistake, the authors do the same thing later in their book. As they recount the history of American immigration,
they list the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901 as an example of violence caused by immigration[^zmirak-on-Czolgosz]. William McKinley's assassin (Leon Czolgosz) was born in Detroit, as much 
an American as either author, but the fact that his father was an immigrant from Poland made him, in the eyes of the authors, a son of Poland, rather than of Detroit.


## 2 Saying U.S. citizens should not be educated if their parents came illegally.

Restrictionists widely oppose allowing unauthorized migrant children into public schools. Even those restrictionists who
agree it should be allowed, at least complain about the cost of this education (even though the United States on average makes much more money
back from every child educated than was spent in their education, regardless of immigration status). What shouldn't be forgotten, though, is that
this approbation extends to native-born U.S. citizens too, if their parents are immigrants.

## 3 Switching from "immigrant" to "immigrant-led household" when measuring fiscal costs.

Despite restrictionist claims, both authorized and unauthorized immigrants use social services at lower rates than U.S. citizens.

One way to exagerrate the fiscal costs of immigration is to use estimates that focus instead on "immigrant-headed households",
as compared to households headed by native-born citizens. Immigrant-headed households usually have citizen children
or spouses, and since these citizens qualify for benefits, their fiscal costs are much greater than if all members
of the household had been immigrants.

So naturally, restrictionist complaints about fiscal costs repeatedly use this "immigrant-headed household" metric, letting them
add in the cost of the native-born citizens in these households. In so doing, restrictionists are targetting not just the immigrant breadwinners,
but any U.S. citizen who lives with them. 

## 4 Switching from "immigrants" to "Hispanic people" when arguing for restrictions.

Two-thirds of all Hispanic people in the United States are native-born citizens, with just as much right to be called 'American'
as any other citizen. Evenso, restrictionist literature often makes it clear that, in the eyes of restrictionists, it is not
just Hispanic immigrants who are 'part of the problem', but *all* Hispanic people in the country.

 * In "Fighting Immigration Anarchy", Daniel Sheehy says the country is in danger of 'colonization'... but cites the Coalition of Hispanic Organizations 
(rather than an immigrant organization).[^sheehy-hispanic]

Daniel Sheehy paints an unsavory picture of filthy and obnoxious renters, but identifies them only as "Hispanic".[^sheehy-renters]

Ann Coulter complains that "Hispanics" are "half as likely to enlist in the military", and are over-represented in prison.[^coulter-hispanic] She doesn't even mention the same statistics for immigrants.

And popular restrictionist Pat Buchanan specifically excludes immigrants in many of his attacks on Hispanic native-born citizens. He complains about the test scores of Hispanic citizens being too low [^buchanan-scores], 
and expresses terror at projected future where there were more Hispanic Americans than Hispanic Mexicans [^buchanan-more-Americans]. In his book, "State of Emergency", Buchanan never expresses any particular fear over *immigrant* birth rates, but is explicitly
deeply concerned about *Hispanic* birth rates [^buchanan-birth-rates].


# 5 Advocating for five million citizen children to either be exiled, or to live with broken families.

In their writings and speeches, restrictionists are often horrified at the idea of living near foreigners.
[Cite the "I left my father in a spanish-speaking nursing home].
From language to values, from poverty to 

One would think that restrictionists would be equally horrified at the idea of a U.S. citizen child growing up overseas: it's all the same 
fears multiplied tenfold. A U.S. citizen child growing up in Mexico might not have access to an English-speaking school, for example 
(far worse than the apparent terror of some students having Spanish-speaking friends in the U.S.). On the whole, these citizen children would be much 
less safe, have fewer educational opportunities, and be deprived of the cultural saturation that restrictionists claim to prize.

But many restrictionists are quite happy to send these citizen children out of the country 
during their formative years.


And if restrictionists *must* conceive of values as either viruses to be spread, or substances to be diluted[^prager], then they've 
completely shot themselves in the foot by pushing for this policy; By deporting so many citizen children, restrictionists have created a situation
where millions of people who have never lived in the U.S. will have the absolute right to enter into it. We, as a nation, had a 
chance for these two-million odd citizens to grow up with American customs and American freedoms, and we instead thought it best 
that there be *fewer* of our own

[Cite the "Oh, it's not the bad for U.S. kids to grow up outside the U.S."]

# 6 Calling for naturalized U.S. citizens to be deported.

The restrictionist call for revoking birthright citizenship is well-known, and a moral failing in and of itself 
(the mere fact that we uncontroversially grant citizenship to the children of native murderers suggests the absurdity that
a native committing murder is a lesser offense than an immigrant overstaying a visa). 

Lesser known is the fact that restrictionists sometimes call for naturalized U.S. citizens to be deported as well.
One example of this is Charlie Kirk's call to deport Ilhan Omar [^5]
