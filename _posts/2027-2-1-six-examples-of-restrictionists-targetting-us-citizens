# [X] Examples of How Restrictionists Target U.S. Citizens
## 

>**_The Short Stuff:_** 


Like other historical efforts to cleanly divide populations into "us" and "them", 


# 1 Listing a citizen murdererer in a collection of violent immigrant criminals

Many restrictionists make a disgusting habit of gathering up lists of violent crimes committed by immigrants. They collect them from police reports, or ask
poeple online to submit any stories they find. Sometimes, to keep up the idea that they are "only against illegal immigration, not all
immigration", they'll limit their list to unauthorized immigrants. But if they're getting a little sloppy (or a little strapped for salacious stories)
they'll include examples of United States citizens who have an immigrant parent.

# 2 Saying U.S. citizens should not be educated if their parents came illegally.

# 3 Switching from "immigrant" to "immigrant-led household" when measuring fiscal costs.

Despite restrictionist claims, both authorized and unauthorized immigrants use social services at lower rates than U.S. citizes.

One way to exagerrate the fiscal costs of immigration is to use estimates that focus instead on "immigrant-headed households",
as compared to households headed by native-born citizens. Immigrant-headed households usually have citizen children
or spouses, and since these citizens qualify for benefits, their fiscal costs are much greater than if all members
of the household had been immigrants.

So naturally, restrictionist complaints about fiscal costs repeatedly use this "immigrant-headed household" metric, letting them
add in the cost of the citizens in these households. In so doing, restrictionists are targetting not just the immigrant breadwinners,
but any U.S. citizen who lives with them. 

# 4 Switching from "immigrants" to "Hispanic people" when arguing for restrictions.

Of the 

Popular restrictionist Pat Buchanan revealed his view of Hispanic citizens when he 

# 5 Advocating for five million citizen children to either be exiled, or live with broken families.

In their writings and speeches, restrictionists are often horrified at the idea of living near foreigners.
[Cite the "I left my father ina spanish-speaking nursing home].
From language to values, from poverty to 

One would think that restrictionists would be horrified at the idea of a U.S. citizen child growing up overseas: it's all the same 
fears multiplied tenfold. A citizen child growing up in Mexico might not have access to an English-speaking school, for example 
(far worse than the apparent horror of some students having spanish-speaking friends in the U.S.). On the whole, these citizens would be much 
less safe, have fewer educational opportunities, and be deprived of .

And if restrictionists *much* conceive of values as either viruses to be spread, or substances to be diluted.
By creating a situation where so many citizen children are deported, restrictionists have created a situation
where millions of people who have never lived in the U.S. will have the absolute right to enter into it.

[Cite the "Oh, it's not the bad for U.S. kids to grow up outside the U.S."]

# 6 Calling for naturalized U.S. citizens to be deported.

The restrictionist call for revoking birthright citizenship is well-known, and a moral failing in and of itself 
(the mere fact that we uncontroversially grant citizenship to the children of native murderers suggests that to a restrictionist,
a native committing murder is a lesser offense than a field laborer overstaying a visa). 

Lesser known is the fact that restrictionists sometimes call for naturalized U.S. citizens to be deported as well.
One example of this is Charlie Kirk's call to deport Ilhan Omar [^5]
