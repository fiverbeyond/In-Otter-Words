# Answering Twenty Questions: Part One
## My responses to a list of restrictionist questions.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In their book, "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Immigration",
authors Johnh Zmirak and Al Perrotta list twenty questions for their readers to ask "in all sincerity".
These are my responses.


### `1) Is all the “benefit” from illegal immigrants (cheap yard work, new taco trucks, more votes for Democrats) worth the life of one American killed by an illegal immigrant whom we didn’t deport because of political correctness?`

Yes, definitely, for many reasons. One is that this benefit also includes lives *saved* by unauthorized immigrants (like by those 200k undocumented workers in the healthcare industry
(https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2021/01/01114801/EW-Health-factsheet.pdf).

Asking whether the number of murderers within a group outweighs the "benefit" of a group is a morally bankrupt approach to 
how we treat people. To see this, just ask the same question about Mets fans, brunettes, or people who eat their oreos
without splitting. Does the "benefit" of allowing these groups to exist outweigh the fact that occasionally, they will produce murderers?

Implicit in this question may be the assumption that unauthorized immigrants commit violent crime at higher rates than U.S. citizens. They don't.[^1] Even if they did, it would still be inappropriate to blame the entire group for the crimes of the minority. There's some evidence that left-handed people are more likely to commit sexual crimes[^2], but only a fool would 
use this as an argument to remove southpaws from society.

### `2) Was Alexander Hamilton wrong when he argued for a “harmony of ingredients” when considering who could immigrate?`

Hamilton never made this argument.

This Hamilton quote comes from [The Examination Number VII](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0282), a
response to President Jefferson's 1801 message to Congress. It doesn't mention immigration. Instead, this section
of Hamilton's paper is about naturalization. In my experience, restrictionists often confuse these two.

Hamilton was arguing for changing the naturalization laws of the U.S. from what the Founders had originally decided (that foreigners 
would be eligible for naturalization immediately upon arriving in the United States). I'll let Hamilton speak for himself here:

`In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed...
The present law was merely a temporary measure adopted under peculiar circumstances and perhaps demands revision. 
There is a wide difference between closing the door altogether and throwing it entirely open; between a postponement of fourteen years and an immediate admission to all the rights of citizenship.`

Restrictionists like to quote this essay because Hamilton, in arguing for a mere 5-year waiting period for naturalization, uses terms similar to what restrictionists use: he speaks of "the evils of incorporating large numbers of foreigners"
and that they "corrupt the national spirit". But Hamilton never argued for imposing any kind of immigration restriction... only for a modest waiting period for naturalization.

### `3) Should an immigration policy be about creating diversity for diversity’s sake? Punishing America for its past “sins”? Or strengthening America for the future?`

Like all broad-scale policy affecting the lives of millions, immigration policy should not be limited to just one goal. I would certainly reject any need for a policy to "punish America", and I would just as strongly object to the implication that immigrants are a 'punishment'. Diversity for diversity sake alone also doesn't strike me as a good goal, but programs that aim to gaurantee diversity (like the Diversity Visa Lottery) often pursue other more defensible goals (like fairness, or equity). "Strengthening America for the future" certainly seems like a good goal, although in my experience restrictionists tend to abandon this goal when it's put in terms of economic or diplomatic strength.
Other appropriate goals for U.S. immmigration policy would include the following:
 * Promoting and exemplifying American values
 * Guarding American liberties
 * Encouraging the well-being of American citizens
 * Encouraging the well-being of would-be immigrants
 * Encouraging the well-being of foreigners who are not immigrating
 * Developing diplomatic relations with different groups.

All of these are appopriate goals for American immigration policy. No one goal should dominate.

### `4) Is it hypocritical to say that a wall is wrong when your own house has them?`

Of course not. The walls of my house are to protect my private property. Their main job is to shield me and my belongings from the elements. They also give me visual privacy, and make for a nice place to hang my pictures.

It feels condescending to point out how a national border wall differs. The nation is not private property, collectively owned by its citizens. The border wall does a horrible job of keeping out the elements, you can see right through it, and it's really hard to nail pictures to it.

Obviously it's silly to compare these two types of walls as if they fulfilled the same purposes.

### `5) Virtually every illegal immigrant who gets an amnesty, including Dreamers, will benefit from affirmative action preferences, compared to (say) white male combat veterans or displaced coal miners. Is that fair?`

Yes, because both the white male combat veteran and the displaced coal miner have access to a much more important benefit: the rights of U.S. citizenship. 
When I read restrictionist literature, it's always surprising to me how a group so apparently jealous of U.S. citizenship is also quick to assume that 
citizenship isn't important and conveys no particular benefit on those who have it. Time and time again, I read in restrictionist books that immigrants have
more rights, more entitlements, and more privileges than citizens have. No one who appreciates their citizenship would dare say such a thing.

### `6) If you don’t like our limits on legal immigration, exactly how many people do you want pouring into the country? What’s the actual number?`

Oh, they don't need to "pour" into the country, as if they were so much gravy. They can walk, drive, or ride in airplanes!

I recommend starting with three million permanent visas per year, plus another million temporary visas (beyond what the Federal government currently allows). These one million visas would come mainly in the H visa categories.

Once enough time has passed to prove 
that restrictionists' claims of imminent total destruction are baseless, I'd continue raising those caps each year, until it becomes typical for most of them to not be reached within a year.

Restrictionists (like the "populationists" who they are closely connected to) get alot of mileage from asking for an "actual number" for a cap. [Cite a populationist example].
Populationists ask about what cap you would propose for the nation's total population, or for the number of births allowed.
It's a great catch-22, because if the responder proposes a partic0ular number, they can be portrayed as agreeing with restriction in principle,
but if the responder refuses to give a cap, they can be accused of laughably thinking an infinite amount of 'X' is possible.

The truth behind these questions is that for most things in life, and especially for demographics or population, putting a 'cap' on a group
causes nothing but pain. What, after all, should the cap be for the population of your state? For your town? How many rabbis are "too many", exactly?
What limit should the U.S. have on the number of libraries permitted? Or bananas? After all... we can't sustain literally infinite
amounts of these things, so doesn't that mean we should have a state-enforced cap?

Of course not. The numbers of these things (but especially of people) should be left to free markets and to individual choices.

### `7) One hundred forty-seven *million* people would like to move to the United States. Is it xenophobic to say “no” to any of them? If not, then to how many? Where do you draw the line?`"

The "one hundred forty-seven million" number is currently the highest number I've ever seen proposed.

As for whether rejecting immigrants is "xenophobic", to me that clearly depends on your reason for the rejection. If you say "no" to someone because of their body height, you're not being xenophobic... just 
prejudiced. If you say "no" to someone because of their race, that's probably racist. If you say "no" because they are too
poor, it would be classist. 

In order to be xenophobic, you would need to say "no" to someone because you're scared of the effects of having foreigners live in your society.
You may be afraid that foreigners are innately less moral than you, or are disease-ridden, or violent, or that the mere presence of cultures different will weaken, cripple, and destroy yours.

Does any of this sound familiar?

As for the question of "Where do I draw the line", I'm more than happy to draw the line at the same place that I would for U.S. citizens. It's perfectly acceptable for governments to stop a foreigner who is a wanted murderer or terrorist, for example, or who is known to be carrying a particularly dangerous disease. Of course, these would justify stopping any citizen at the border too.

### '8)The average immigrant in federal prison has been arrested eight times and charged with twelve crimes. How many crimes are you willing to accept before you’re willing to kick them out of the country?"

It's not the number of crimes that matters to how severe a punishment should be, but the severity. Two traffic tickets are not worse than one murder.

### 9) If illegals are doing the work Americans won’t do, do you favor eliminating the minimum wage and safety regulations in those fields? Because that’s what illegal immigration does, in effect.

I am not in favor of eliminating safety regulations in these fields (although I admit that I could imagine compromises on  abolishing the minimum wage for immigrants). In fact, if ICE were narrowly focused on seeking out dangerous workplace violations, I might not be in favor of their abolition. However, I reject the claim that it is the immigration that weakens these worker protections, rather than the fact that this immigration is made illegal.

Our restrctions greatly empower the employers who exploit unauthorized workers. Without these restrictions, the workers would have the protections that let them report their employers, and appeal to the government for safety and wage regulations. For over sixty years, restrictionists have assured the public that continuing to restrict low-skill immigration would eventually make these exploitative practices diminish. They have failed dramatically, and re

### `10) Why would you be on the same side of this issue as George Soros, a bitter socialist with designs on reshaping the politics of dozens of countries via shadowy front groups?`

On any divisive issue, there will be villains who land "on the same side" of that issue as you.
I wouldn't be so childish as to ask a restrictionist why they are on the same side of this issue as Kim Jung Un.
