# Heroes in Immigration
## Recognizing people for their valorous actions in the cause of immigration reform.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** It's important to 'call out' good behaviour.

Naming heroes is a risk business; one has to fully expect that 


## Senator Chris Van Hollen

In her book "A Problem from Hell", Samantha Powers does an admirable job of detailing how seemingly banal visits to foreign
nations can be vital in fighting for human rights. I'm also reminded of the imprisonment of Alexei Navalny, when the Kremlin had to regularly refuse reporters requests to visit Navalny in prison.  Let me say up front that I don't think ICE's actions are on par with those of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. My point is just that, when tortuous incarceration is used to 'disappear' people forever, even a mere visit can be a threat to the powers that be.

When Kilmar Abrego Garcia was thrown into CECOT, Senator Chris Van Hollen could have simply released a statement of vague sympathy. He could have deferred to the courts, or written a strongly worded letter, or distracted voters from the whole issue.

"It is absolutely unjust and illegal to have this Marylander detained one more day in a notorious prison in El Salvador."[^chris-van-hollen-its-unjust]

Instead, he took the time, resources, and effort to arrange a face-to-face visit with Kilmar. Such a simple request, merely to meet face to face with a prisoner... and yet it evidently caused a scramble. The CECOT torture camp was publicly hailed as a place where no one would ever be allowed to leave [^el-salvador-never-leave], but shortly before the Senator's visit, Kilmar did just that. Before the meeting, he was transferred to a different prison with more humane conditians, and eventually, he returned to the United States, making a proud open mockery of Kristi Noem's claims that he would "never return"[^never-return]). President Bukele's social media posts that were meant to make the visit look luxurious (by staging margaritas in the photo) backfired beautifully when the Senator took the time to publicly point out the staging [^chris-van-hollen-staging].

It's not often that I need to begrudgingly admire the actions of a U.S. Senator, but Van Hollen's boldness made me hope that, should I be whisked away without due process, my Senator might have the guts to stand up for me.

## Nathan Clark

  Anyone who has watched much restrictionist advocacy is familiar with "angel moms". These are the mothers of U.S. citizens who were killed by immigrants (sometimes through murder, but more often via accidents). Restrictionist organizations are fairly adept at gathering these stories, connecting angel mothers together, and giving them platforms to express their grief over the loss of their child, and to transmute that grief into anger against all unauthorized immigrants.

  The use of "angel moms" in this way is too deep a topic to touch on now, except to say that I don't blame these mothers at all. I haven't personally lost a child, and I can't imagine the long, sustained grief that must come from losing any loved one in such a violent way as a car crash. It's only human to look for some way to give meaning to your child's passing.

  That's why I was so surprised and inspired by the actions of Nathan Clark, the father of Aiden Clark. Aiden was tragically killed in the 2023 Clark County School bus crash. The immigrant driver who caused the crash had no license, and in court proceedings was found to be clearly at fault for the accident. In such a horrific  time of mourning, I would hope that any father would at least be left alone. I certainly wouldn't blame any father for refusing to comment.

But Nathan Clark rose above these temptations. 

"I wish that my son, Aiden Clark, was killed by a 60-year-old white man. I bet you never thought you would hear anyone say something so blunt. But if that guy had killed my eleven-year-old son, the incessant group of hate-spewing people would leave us alone."[^nathan-clark-sixty-year]

Rather than passively see his son's name used as an anti-immigration talking point, he took what must have been a painful effort to speak out. He openly chastized the people who would use Aiden's story as a bludgeon against the Springfield immigrants, calling out politicians by name, and explicitly defending the Haitian immigrants in Springfield.

  "They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members. However they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed, to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio. I will listen to them one more time to hear their apologies."[^nathan-clark-apologies]


## Aaron Reichlin-Melnik

   Finally, a different kind of hero, to balance out the first two examples. Unlike the first two examples, Mr. Reichlin-Melnik did not have a 'moment' when the public spotlight fell on him during a 'hot' controversy, nor did he have a risky, brave action that caught people's attention. Mr. Reichlin-Melnik is a Senior Fellow at the American Immigration Council,
and I think he's a hero because of what he does in his day-to-day job.

"Undocumented immigrants are also more than their jobs. They are parents, spouses, partners, brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, loved ones and friends to millions of U.S. citizens and permanent residents."[^reichlin-melnik-spouses]

Besides testifying in front of congress. His social media advocacy really is meant to educate and illucidate, rather than anger or radicalize. Most of all, Mr. Reichlin-Melnik stands out amongst immigration advocates
for a golden trait: his optimism. In a world where immigration reform can feel deadlocked, he manages to see the paths forward that are invisible to the casual social-media viewer.

"If Trump actually does convince people that the border is under control... then that will take some of the pressure off of those who repeatedly said 'I won't do anything on legal immigration and the undocumented population
until we fix the border.' And there is some bipartisan support right now for some answers."[reichlin-melnik-compromise]

The simple  truth is that I put Mr. Reichlin-Melnik on this list because he is a similar age to me, but has made the right decisions in his life to be an imporant active part in the struggle for immigrant rights.
