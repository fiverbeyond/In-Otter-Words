# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #3 : The Lifeboat Analogy
## Allowing more immigration is not like letting a lifeboat get swamped.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** One of the most popular metaphors used in discussing immigration is that of a lifeboat on the verge of capsizing.
Restrictionists say that letting more immigrants in risks "capsizing" the nation, drowning everyone. This is a dumb idea.

Browsing through restrictionist metaphors brings a strange, sickly delight. There's always a vain sense of superiority to be had in pointing out fallacies in arguments, even this weakness.  This blog has already addressed [the gumball analogy], and Aldo Buttazonni's [Halloween analogy], and one day, I plan to dive gleefully into what I consider the crown jewel of restrictionst metaphors: "Letting someone into your country is like letting someone into your house."

Today I address one of the great classics in the field, Garret Hardin's "Lifeboat Metaphor". Garrett Hardin was a Professor of Human Ecology at the University of California in the 60s and 70s. His most widely-known contribution is his popularization of "The Tragedy of the Commons". Lesser known is his 1970s application of this idea to immigration, i.e., the "Lifeboat Metaphor". This was one of the first metaphors I ever heard for exploring the ethics of restrictionism, and it's used widely enough that even the popular educational channel Crash Course described it in their series on ethics (which I highly recommend). 

In this post, I'll explain the metaphor and show a few implications that, in my opinion, suggest it's a bad analogy.
In later follow-up post, I will detail the reasons behind why I reject the analogy, following my preferred three-step approach to
[dissolving an analogy].

## The Lifeboat Analogy

Let's have Mr. Hardin describe the metaphor in his own words:

"Metaphorically, each rich nation amounts to a lifeboat full of comparatively rich people. The poor of the world are in other, much more crowded lifeboats. Continuously, so to speak, the poor fall out of their lifeboats and swim for a while in the water outside, hoping to be admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in some other way to benefit from the 'goodies' on board."

Prof. Hardin continues by explaining the catastrophe that awaits from allowing even a small amount of immigration, 
"We may be tempted to try to live by the Christian ideal of being "our brother's keeper"... We take all the needy into our boat, making
a total of 150 in a boat with a capacity of 60. The boat is swamped, and everyone drowns. Complete justice, complete catastrophe."

Hardin then continues by pointing out the difficult moral choices that accompany trying to let in only "just enough" survivors into a lifeboat, and instead concludes that the only appropriate action is to admit no person at all, and instead to let all outside survivors drown, rather than
risk the catastrophe of the lifeboat capsizing.

## The Ethics the Lifeboat is Appealing To

It's important to point out that, in steel-man form, I agree with the basic ethics of the lifeboat scenario. If I was in a lifeboat clearly filled to capacity, and I could be reasonably certain of impending capsize, it would be morally permissible to deny entry to swarms of swimmers. The mechanics here are truly horrifying: it could be done by rowing away and leaving the stragglers to their deaths, by shoving them off with oars, or even shooting them as they approach. It's a ghastly idea, but in those strict parameters, I find myself agreeing with Hardin when he says "The lifeboat, as it were, purifies itself of guilt." If the only alternative were a complete capsize (leading to the death of all the survivors already in the lifeboat) it would be morally required. As usual with utilitarianism, the pill is bitter, but for me, the morality holds up under inspection. I'll note that it's a little paradoxical for Hardin to be appealing to utilitarianism here, since he outright rejects it as a moral code (Hardin, pg. 14-15).

So, why do I think it's a bad analogy?

## Showing the Analogy is Flawed

For right now, let's not concern ourselves with *why* this analogy is bad. That's an exercise for the follow-up post.
Instead, I hope I can at least convince any restrictionist readers of *the mere fact* that the lifeboat analogy is bad.
It doesn't explain reality in a useful way, and its proposed real-world solutions are, well, pretty dumb.
To show this, let's conosider some straightforward implications of the metaphor.

### 1. The Lifeboat Metaphor Straightforwardly Demands Outlawing Childbirth

The first obviously troubling implication with the Lifeboat metaphor is actually introduced by Hardin himself:
"The harsh characteristicrs of lifeboat ethics are heightened by reproduction, particularly by reproductive differences. The people inside the lifeboats of the wealthy nations are doubling in numbesr every 87 years."
 Hardin doesn't explore the immediate implications for this idea with respect to directly applying the metaphor. For the purposes of the metaphor, any child born to a native family in the lifeboat is just as much a threat as any immigrant, and so the inhabitants of the lifeboat have just as much a right to prevent these births from happening as they do to stop immigration. Just as the lifeboat inhabitants are supposedly justified in using violence to stop immigrants, so would they be justified in using violence to prevent reproduction (after all, in the metaphor, every birth risks the ruin of everyone aboard.) It gets even worse than that: just as it would be permissible,
according to the lifeboat metaphor, to leave desparate survivors to die, this also demands that any children that *are* born should likewise
be left to die "in the water". In other words, if the metaphor holds, the U.S. government should forcefully separate any newborns, strip them of citizenship, and deport them, lest the entire nation risk destruction. 

I hope that, for most people, the idea of the Federal government imposing strict birth
limits via violence sounds horrifically dystopian. This might suggest that our nation is not, in fact, like a nearly-swamped lifeboat, but this example is only the top of the pile...


### 2. The Lifeboat Metaphor Straightforwardly Justifies Expelling Native-Born U.S. Citizens

As we'll discuss later, people who propose the lifeboat analogy wisely keep far away from actually giving a carrying-capacity of the United States. The analogy mongers its fear just by the assurance that whatever the 'tipping point' of our lifeboat is, we must be very close to it, and crossing it
will certainly lead to utter destruction.

But if you hand-wave away the need for accountable estimates of that tipping point, the lifeboat analogy suddenly
justifies *any* action that excludes people from the lifeboat. You could be sitting alone in 
a luxury yacht, and still be justified in violently stopping anybody from climbing aboard. After all, 
you don't know the exact carrying capacity of the yacht, and therefore, says the analogy, you are 
justified in preventing anybody from joining you. But why stop there? As long as we're agreeing to turn a blind
eye to actually measuring any tipping point, then we must admit that it could be the case that the lifeboat is
already overpopulated, and the only way to guarantee our safety is to begin tossing people overboard. Prof. Hardin himself
openly suggests that the U.S. was already over capacity... in 1974. [Quote Hardin]

There's every reason, within the lifeboat analogy, to immediately select native-born citizens to expel from
the lifeboat (since the presence of any such citizen threatens the doom of everyone in the nation). 
Not only would the federal government be justified in stripping millions of their citizenship
and deporting them, but they are *currently morally obligated* to do so. Any hesitance in doing so would fall under what Prof. Hardin 
describes as "Christian-Marxian idealism": a misguided over-attachment to fairness that leads directly to the Tragedy of the Commons.

And it gets worse than that. Since the lifeboat analogy eschews any strict measure of overpopulation, this violent expulsion would be justified, even for the majority of citizens. As long as *any* citizen still lived in the U.S., the government is morally obligated to expel other citizens (because every citizen threatens to tip the nation into its capsize mechanic.).

### History Strongly Suggests that the Lifeboat Metaphor is Nonsense

In his essay, Hardin sees the lifeboat metaphor as a direct application of the Tragedy of the Commans. "In a crowded world of less than perfect human beings -- and we will never know any other -- mutual ruin is inevitable in the commons. This is the core of the Tragedy of the Commons." 
But if this is so, then Hardin's metaphor should have produced myriad examples in situations where free movement is allowed. Take migration between U.S. states, for example. For most of U.S. history, the states have had open borders, allowing completely free movement between them. If the lifeboat analogy were a close description of reality, we should have seen many of these state capsize: not just 'an economic downturn', but a full-blown catastrophe of utter destruction, where the population of the state reached its 'tipping point', and suddenly everyone in the state becomes equally destitute.
This doesn't happen.

The same is true for migration between counties or cities. One could even defend a bold claim here: in the entire history of the U.S., from the hundreds of cities and counties that have existed, *not one* of them has ever 'capsized' in the way the lifeboat metaphor suggests. Yes, some towns go bankrupt, and some indusries collapse, but not a single example here has all the traits that are vital to the lifeboat metaphor, namely:
 * The disaster is triggered strictly by overpopulation
 * The disaster is sudden.
 * The disaster results in the complete destitution of everyone in the city (the 'lifeboat').

In all of the local examples, most people can immediately see how silly the lifeboat comparison is.  Those who push the lifeboat analogy as a good metaphor for
international migration need to explain why the analogy fails for every kind of bordered government, with the single proposed exception of sovereign nation-states. 
What is it about national borders that make a capsize event utterly unavoidable in their case, but make it practically unimaginable in the case
of states, cities, neighborhoods, etc?

Even if you could come up with a meaningful explanation for this, the history of nation states itself is strong evidence against the lifeboat metaphor. 
The nations within the Schengen Area have shared open borders with each other for decades: twenty-nine "lifeboats" that have,
according to the metaphor, doomed themselves to be upended. This never happened.

### "But we *have* seen nations capsize! 

When challenged with this utter lack of historical precedent for a capsize mechanic, one might be tempted to counter that we *have* seen cities, counties, states, and nations 'capsize' in the way Hardin describes. One might point to Chicago's housing crisis, or the Greek debt crisis, or the eternally persistent example of the Fall of the Roman Empire. It's especially easy for populationists (and restrictionists) to claim that any given economic crisis is caused by overpopulation, since almost any famine, war, or housing shortage could be cast as "Too many people for too few resources").

This defense doesn't hold any water. In the first place, no reasonable understanding of economic crashes would be so simple as to attribute them to 'overpopulation' or migration.
Chicago's problems were about industries collapsing, not too many U.S. citizens moving within its boundaries. The Greek debt crises had apparently no relation to any imagined "carrying capacity". And no, despite what some restrictionists say, Rome did not fall from having too many people.

But there's a second and more important reason to reject this defense: even if every example of a fiscal crisis in America was due solely to citizen migration, 
these examples would still be nowhere near the kind of utter devastation described by the Lifeboat metaphor's capsize mechanic. Remember that the whole point of
the lifeboat metaphor is that reaching the moment of capsize results in total destruction [Quote restrictionist examples here], leaving all inhabitants
in a position of equal destitution (as Hardin says "Complete justice, complete catastrophe."
This doesn't happen.

### To Be Continued

I hope these implications are at least enough to make a reader question the soundness of the Lifeboat Metaphor. 
Evenso, it's not enough to simply suspect that the metaphor is unsound: we should take the time to understand *why* it is unsound as well.
For this ethical adventure, I invite you to join me in a Part Two of this post, where we'll poke some unstoppable breaches
in the hull of this floundering vessel.
