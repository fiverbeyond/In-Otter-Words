# Five Books that FAIR and I Both Recommend
## Looking for compromise, in an organization I disagree with.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** FAIR, one of the most prominent restrictionists organizations, publishes a list of recommended books
promoting restrictionism. I read all of them, and would personally recommend some
to anybody who wants to learn more about restrictionism.


Talking about immigration reform is like churning a pile of compost: it's messy, stinky and heated.
(Did you know that compost naturally heats itself? I didn't.)

It doesn't feel right to post about the ethics of immigration without regularly listening to "the other side",
and one good representative of "the other side" is the Foundation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR for short.
FAIR is one of the biggest restrictionism advocacy groups, and along with the many forms of media they use (blog posts, videos, a podcast), they 
promote [a list of recommended books](https://www.fairus.org/issue/suggested-reading-immigration). 
And now I've read them all!

### Why Recommend Restrictionist Literature?

  * To understand restrictionism, as a political position.
  * To be aware of what rhetoric is being employed against expansionism.
And of course, most importantly...
  * To honestly search for and consider the best arguments against the positions I promote.

And so without further ado, here is my list of books, recommended by FAIR, which I also recommend.


## 5 - Why Does Immigration Divide America? (2005) by Gordon H. Hanson

Of all the books on FAIR's reading list, this was my favorite; I list it in last place out of the suspicion that it should actually 'count' as expansionist literature,
rather than restrictionist. From the reading, I can't even tell whether the author, Gordon Hanson, is himself restrictionist, and I want to keep it that way. 
In this blessedly short book (almost a pamphlet) the author makes an honest, empirical, and data-driven attempt to analyze the reasons behind popular restrictionism.

"Distributive conflicts appear to be at the heart of disagreements over immigration policy. Fortunately, policy options are available that can lessen the 
distributive consequences of immigration, and move the United States toward an immigration policy that better serves the national interest."[^hansons_thesis]


## 4 - Falling Behind (2014) by Michael S. Teitelbaum

"Falling Behind" attempts to disprove the idea that America is (or recently was) undergoing a skilled labor shortage.

"One of the more unusual aspectrs of lobbying and activism on immigration policy is that it cannot be understood along the conventional ideological dimensions
of left or right, liberal or conservative... Instead, immigration lobbying has been dominated by interest groups on th eleft and the right that have good connections with both political parties."

## 3 - Heaven's Door

Ah, Borjas. 
George J. Borjas is by far the one economist most cited by restrictionist literature.  I'd heard his name dozens of times before I ever started reading his work.
Without initially knowing anything about him, I may have even harbored a hope that Borgas would turn out to be some sort of crank or ideological
polemicist.

The opposite is the case. Borgas isn't just a widely respected economist, he's also an entertaining read. 

"[Having no immigration at all] would leave many people -- the immigrants who could benefit greatly from the opportunity of sharing in the American dream and who 
could, in turn, benefit the American people -- forever knocking on heaven's door."[^borjas_closing_line]

Borgas carefully checks his own work, spells out his assumptions, and isn't shy about results he finds that counter 
popular restrictionist talking points. By everything I can see (and by the way other economists talk about him), I can't more highly recommend 
Borgas as a good source of information on the economic impact of immigration.


## 2 - Huddled Masses, Muddled Laws

"That immigration will broach such acrimonious issues is not unexpected: immigration, unlike many other forms of public policy, has the power literally to change 
the face of the nation. And such a momentous change should require a thorough and judicious debate."[^lees_last_line]


##  1 - The New Case Against Immigration by Mark Krikorian

The New Case Against Immigration has a refreshingly unusual premise, summed up in this thesis: [source this] "Immigration is harmful for America, not because the immigrants are different,
but because we are different." In other words, Mr. Krikorian argues that as America has advanced from an agrarian colony to a world superpower, so too has it's ability to allow or block immigration. Low-skill 
manual laborers may have been useful to the U.S. in the past, but now we're a 

I like this book for many reasons. For one, it truly is a "new case" against immigration that breaks from the arguments I usually find in restrictionist books. The premise
guards against charges of anti-immigrant attacks, even outright saying that immigrants today are no less deserving than those of the past (a very unusual claim for 
a restrictionist book). 

"The simple fact that most immigrants now come from Latin America and Asia, rather than from Europe, is of less importance with regard to assimilation
than some observers seem to think. Instead, it is *we* who have changed.[^krikorians_thesis]"

The premise also makes for a strong argument simply by reflecting so much truth about America's history with immigration; America *has* changed, it *has* become 
wealthier and more industrialized, and it's ability to restrict immigration has grown dramatically.

Of all the restrictionists I read (or watch), Mark Krikorian seems to me to be the most authentically on his guard against 
those regular accusations of xenophobia, racism, or even nativism. A typical 'pop restrictionism' book will collect only those anti-immigration quotes from the Founding Fathers,
but Mr. Krikorian includes quotes that I typically hear from expansionists. He also
