# Is THAT what we mean by "Mass Deportation"?
## Twelve million deportations? Or less than a 500,000?

# By "mass deportation", restrictionists mean that all unauthorized immigrants will be deported.

Quoting Trump as a restrictionist might be a bit unfair, as he's probably not familiar with the realities
of immigration policy the way his Border Czar
