 # "Who Are You Calling 'Restrictionist', Buster?"
## A quick FAQ on the language I use.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** 


## Why do I use the term 'restrictionist'?

The main reason why I use the term "restrictionist" is because this is word that such people use to describe themselves.
F.A.I.R., the Center for Immigration Studies, and NumbersUSA each recommend books that use 'restrictionist' to describe their
positions, and I haven't heard any other term proposed by them.

If someone objects to being called a restrictionist, I'm happy to call them by whichever term they would prefer to describe
"someone who advocates for more immigration restrictions, or for maintaining our current restrictions".

## Who qualifies as a 'restrictionist'?

When I use the word 'restrictionist', I mean either someone who advocates for more immigration restrictions than the U.S. currently has,
or who advocates for the status quo (which I would describe as "heavily restricted"). Conversely, I would consider
someone an immigration expansionist if they advocate for fewer restrictions. 

All political descriptions lie on a spectrum, of course. A critic might claim that I, too, support immigration restrictions
of one sort or another, even if it's as slim as "Don't let known terrorists enter the country." I think this 
pedantry would render the term meaningless, but I'm willing.
