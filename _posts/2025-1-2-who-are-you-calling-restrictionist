 # "Who Are You Calling 'Restrictionist', Buster?"
## A quick FAQ on the language I use.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** 


## What do I mean by the word "restrictionist"?

When I use the word 'restrictionist', I mean either someone who advocates for more immigration restrictions than the U.S. currently has,
or who advocates for the status quo (which I would describe as "heavily restricted"). Conversely, I would consider
someone an immigration expansionist if they advocate for fewer restrictions. 

All political descriptions lie on a spectrum, of course. A critic might claim that I, too, support immigration restrictions
of one sort or another, even if it's as slim as "Don't let known terrorists enter the country." I think this 
pedantry would render the term meaningless, but I'm willing.

## Why do I use the term 'restrictionist'?

The main reason why I use the term "restrictionist" is because this is word that such people use to describe themselves.
F.A.I.R., the Center for Immigration Studies, and NumbersUSA each recommend books that use 'restrictionist' to describe their
positions, and I haven't heard any other term proposed by them.

If someone objects to being called a restrictionist, I'm happy to call them by whichever term they would prefer to describe
"someone who advocates for more immigration restrictions, or for maintaining our current restrictions".

## What terms do I use to describe my own positions?

I like the term "expansionist" to describe what I advocate for: a loosening of our immigration restrictions.
I also use the term "open border advocate" to describe myself, although it's important to note that these terms
are not synonymous: most expansionists are not open-border advocates, in my experience.

## What is my approach to dissolving analogies?

I very much enjoy using analogies to explore real-world ethics. Ethical reasoning has a long history of useful analogies, from bedrock standards like
The Trolley Problem or Thomson's Violinist, to Peter Singer's 'Child in the Pond' obscure niches like the Starvin' Marvin thought experiment. I think 
many analogies are good distillations of ethics in our world today. but just as many are 'bad fits' that should rightfully be critiqued.
When critiquing an analogy, I like to follow a simple three-step pattern:

1.) Clarify the Analogy
Restate the analagy and specifically spell out the comparisons it is making. I like to do this as a table of "Targets" (the real-world ideas being
explained) and "Sources" (the fictional stand-in, or analogue).

2.) List the relevant differences from reality.
If an analogy fails to describe an ethical choice, it's because it differs from reality, not just in specific details, but in morally relevant ways.
In this step, these differences are listed and clarified.

3) Prove the relevance of the differences by saying I would accept the analogy if they were resolved.
After listing the differences, if I really have captured relevant differences between the analogy and the real-world situation being
explained, I think I have an epistemic duty to "prove" that my differences are morally relevant, rather than simply distractions.
A strong way to prove the relevance is to re-imagine the analogy, with the differences resolved, and then say that in this version
of the analogy, I would agree with its conclusions. This holds me accountable to my claim about the moral relevance.

This is the approach I take when dissolving analogies.
