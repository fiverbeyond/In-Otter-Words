# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #1
## Unauthorized immigrants are not like parents who steal candy from children.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Aldo Buttazonni says that unauthorized immigrants are like parents who steal Halloween candy, but this metaphor doesn't make any sense when you think about it. It turns out to be simple prejudiced smearing
> with no ethical substance.

Happy Halloween season, my fellow dark spirits! It's that blustery time of year when we suddenly become interested in gourds and make other preparations for that most bizarre and cathartic of our holidays.
And what could be more cathartic than examining a Halloween-themed take on illegal immigration? 


Aldo's video focuses on some porch-camera footage, from someone who left a bowl of treats with a sign on their front porch for trick-or-treaters. In the video, we see some parents greedily taking all of the candy from
the bowl, leaving nothing for future trick-or-treaters. Assuming there's not some kind of misunderstanding going on, I'm sure most people would be disgusted by these actions. 
These people might find it hard to 
make a connection to illegal immigration, but don't worry, Mr. Buttazonni makes the connection!

Okay, so in Aldo's analogy, the citizens of the U.S. are the homeowners, putting out the bowl of candy (social services), and the thieving parents are the unauthorized immigrants, taking all the candy for
themselves, and leaving none for the rightful recipients: the trick-or-treating children. And in this analogy, who are the trick-or-treating children who *should* be getting the candy? 
Mr. Buttazoni explains...

Got it. So the rough analogy looks something like this:
`Homeowners -->  U.S. Citizens
 Bowl -->  Social Services
 Thieves --> Unauthorized Immigrants
 Trick-or-treaters --> U.S. Citizens`

A clean metaphor that paints unauthorized immigrants with the same disgust we would treat these parents who steal candy from children. 
But... what happens if you think about this for a bit?

### Why This Analogy Makes No Sense To Me

Restrictionist and nativist talking points have always relied on some popular, but questionable metaphors, from "A nation is like a house" to "Our lifeboat is about to capsize". Even the eternally popular phrase "Get in line!" 
is just another weak metaphor. 

#### 1. The parents in the video are leaving nothing behind for future trick-or-treaters.

...but unauthorized immigrants aren't leaving social services 'empty' for citizens. Despite what restrictionists say,
for the vast majority of social services, providing the service to unauthorized immigrants does not mean citizens go without.

#### 2. The parents in the video are taking many times more than is allowed to each trick-or-treater

...but unauthorized immigrants aren't using social services at many times more the rate of citizens. In fact, they use social services at lower rates than U.S. citizens.

#### 3. The parents are not the intended target for the candy
...but social services are meant for taxpayers (which includes unauthorized immigrants). Aldo Buttazonni may object to state and local governments including unauthorized immigrants
as intended recipients, but that doesn't mean it never happens. To fit the analogy, this would be like a homeowner
putting candy out, but explicitly allowing all children in the neighborhood to take a piece (not just the children who, say, paid
for the candy in taxes.)

### The Better Analogy

So let's make this analogy fit a little better. Imagine a video where child trick-or-treaters (the intended recipients of the candy) 
take a little less candy from the bowl than others (just like unauthorized immigrants use less in social services than citizens do).
They don't prevent any other trick-or-treaters from getting their candy (just like offering services to these immigrants
doesn't deprive citizens). When you adjust the analogy to fit reality, the moral objection goes away.

That's what Aldo Buttazonni is objecting to.
