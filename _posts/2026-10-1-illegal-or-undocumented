# Words We Use: "Illegal" or "Undocumented"
## Why I usually use the term "unauthorized" when I talk about people who come here illegally.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Some people say we should use "illegal" to describe people who came to the United States illegally. Others tend to use "undocumented". 
In this post, I look at the arguments for "illegal" and explain why they don't make sense to me.


In a previous post, I defended the use of "immigrant" (rather than "alien") to refer to people who are unlawfully
present in the United States. As a follow-up, this post will look at the first half of that recurring phrase, "illegal 
alien". Should we describe such people as "illegal", "undocumented", or something else?

## Some Arguments Against "Illegal"




[Cite undocumented immigrant who prefers 'undocumented']

[Cite CIS pointing out that we do use 'illegal' to describe people sometimes]

[Cite Michelle Malkin's claim about "illegal alien" being used in Federal statutes.]

[Quote Jon Feere]

Mr. Feere is correct here; we do sometimes refer to "illegal loggers". My personal response to this would be to 'bite the bullet'
and say that these uses are just as incorrect (and somewhat dehumanizing) as "illegal immigrant". I would especially avoid 
"illegal logger" if I knew that such loggers objected to the term (the way we know unauthorized immigrants object to being described
as "illegal".)

## Why I Use "Unauthorized"

Altogether, I don't find the arguments for "illegal" to be very convincing, but I have to admit that they have at least more 'meat-on-the-bone'
than the use of "alien". Jon Feere's catch of terms like "illegal loggers" is a legitimate double standard in the media. On top of that, restrictionists
are markedly more consistent in their use of 'illegal', contrasted with their blatant double-standard in their use of 'alien' (which I examined in my previous
post). The arguments against 'undocumented' also hold some water: I would agree that the issue at hand is whether the documents held by immigrants are 'legal
documents' or not. In my fantasy Utopia, we might use the words "illegally documented immigrant" to distinguish those immigrants who use fraudulent documentation,
but that's definitely too much of a mouthful to try to impress on people.

So why do I use "unauthorized"? In the end, I use it as a compromise in an attempt to be polite to restrictionists. It avoids their complaints about
the innacuracy of 'undocumented', while also respecting the immigrant's wishes with respect to the "illegal" label. 


A Post-Script: "Illegal" as a noun.

While I have to admit that describing immigrants as "illegal" has some backing, I can at least draw a boundary against the repeated restrictionist
use of "illegal" as a noun. To describe someone as "an illegal" is entirely unjustified, and is a bad habit that polite
restrictionists should make an effort to avoid. Even by the questionable arguments used to support "illegal immigrant",
using "illegal" as a noun has no backing: it's certainly not a term used in federal statutes, nor is it
equally applied to other groups (no one calls authorized immigrants "legals"). The use of "illegal" as a noun
is so indefensible that to date, I have never heard a single restrictionist defend it.

Perhaps that will change one day. In the meantime, we are justified in calling out this rhetorical stinkweed for
what it appears to be: a simple, dehumanizing slur.
