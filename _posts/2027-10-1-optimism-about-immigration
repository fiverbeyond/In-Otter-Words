# Being Optimistic About Immigration: A Farewell Post
## This is goodbye for now, but let's leave with some hope in our hearts!

>**_The Short Stuff:_** This is the final post on this blog for the foreseeable future, and on the topic of the foreseeable future, it holds promise. 
Expanding the U.S. immigration system may sometimes feel impossible, but there are many ways it could still happen.


# I. The Status Quo: A Most Resilient God

  No sober review of future possibilities can ignore the strength of the status quo. The Federal government (and the American population at large) has spent the last half-century settling into our mire of immigration policies like
a 500-pound prize winning hog settling into a mudpatch. Like the tax system, the immigration system has exploded in complexity over America's history, and a broad erasure of all the immigration visa types
would be akin to the "do your taxes on a postcard" promise that pops up from time to time among populist candidates. For the record, I wouldn't advocate for the one any more than the other.
ICE is well established and powerful, and politically can't be disbanded with a pen stroke. 
  Most importantly, if there's one thing I've learned about restrictionism from my personal study, it's that the broad appeal of restrictionism is eternally imbued in the American population; it's as recurring
as weight loss fads, satanic panic, or MLMs. Polemicists will always be able to appeal to a fear of foreigners, and draw from an ever-flowing font of clicks, views, and engagement from the population at large.
It may well be that in fifty years, we will be in roughly the same situation: millions of undocumented workers, hundreds of thousands of broken families, and a recurring surge of promises to "finally secure the border".
This is not an unlikely path.

# II. The Downturn: "No Matter How Bad Things Get..."
They can always get worse. As horrific as ICE's activities are now, its supporters could succeed in giving them a dramatic increase in funding and legal power. America could build a long history of construction workers and 
fruit pickers being thrown into hellhole overseas torture prisons for decades at time.  Restrictionists successfully get what they want on paper, with millions of people being deported (to the point where only a million or so remain
in hiding or forced into legally-induced poverty) and a fully militarized border. Student, business, and tourist visas become dramatically curtailed, and enough family reunification is blocked to convince thousands of visiting workers 
to leave the country (or avoid coming to the U.S. in the first place). Finally, restrictionists achieve their oft-stated goal of curtailing legal immigration, cutting the numbers down to only a few hundred thousand each year.
America proudly settles onto an immigration policy akin to modern-day Japan's, only with much more imprisonment.

What's especially tragic about this situation is that the greatest harm caused by this outcome would be nearly invisible: it would be the tens of millions of people who were denied a dramatically better life,
a life with more freedom, more safety, and more prosperity. Because this is a missed opportunity, it would be very difficult to convince people of the large-scale harm caused by immigration restrictions, just as it is today.

# III. Surprising Twists

## The Line Between Canada and the United States Blurs
Calls for Canadian statehood become a political talking point, and morph into the opening of the border with Canada (perhaps sold to the American people as 
a first-step toward unification). Nationalistic fears of open borders are subverted by a nationalistic thirst for (apparent) expansion.
This open northern border acts as a precursor for an open southern border.

## A Free-Market Revival Within the Republican Party
A new populist movement builds an identity around free markets, capitalism, or individual liberty. Enough of this fervor slips into immigration policy
to decriminalize undocumented work. Nostalgia for Reaganism takes hold (and recall that Reagan and Bush are widely viewed in restrictionist circles as literally 
being for open borders.)

## Trump: The Restrictionist Dream That Went Nowhere
The Trump administration becomes widely viewed in popular discourse as the most restrictionist administration we are likely to see in our lifetimes, but popular restrictionist talking points 
remain unchanged (namely that there's still an enormous "illegal" population, that it's still trivially easy to sneak into the country, that disaster is imminent, etc). The combination 
of these two ideas produces an understanding that even the most dramatically restrictionist administration possible is unlikely to produce any of the lasting change
that restrictionists want, and they instead call for a compromised reform.

## Another Cold War Stokes a Useful Nationalist Pride
Fear of foreign individuals becomes overtaken by fear of a foreign rival political movement (like communism). The sense of competition drives a push to allow more immigration. For example...
   * To establish a manufacturing base that competes with the rival.
   * To build a larger population than the rival.
   * To build a stronger economy than the rival.
   * To attract more scientists or engineers than the rival.
   * As moral grandstanding in comparison to the rival (if the rival is particularly restrictionist, as in the Cold War era). It's worth remembering that during the Cold War,
the American polity often leaned into its acceptance of refugees from Communist countries, as a chance to show America's willingness to be a leader among free nations.

## An Unusually Strong Backlash to an Unusually Dark Decade
ICE's current actions produce decades of particularly strong backlash, unseen since ICE's formation. One of the forces protecting the past 50 years of status quo in America's immigration
enforcement is the fact that ICE's supposedly severe limitations actually protect their public image. When restricted to picking up known criminals who were caught by local law enforcement,
ICE can more easily convince the public (and themselves) that they are some kind of justice organization. But if given a dramatic increase in funding, alongside a demand to dramatically increase detentions and 
deportations, ICE will be forced to extend their actions to "optically unsafe" targets. The supposedly dastardly crimes of ICE's victims will necessarily become less impressive, and it's embarassing
harm to families, children, and U.S. citizens will become more common.
In the decades to follow, these excesses could support a new and fundamentally unseen basis for public talking points against ICE. With each new documentary, biography, and celebrity victim,
disgust for ICE could become a mainstay in America's political discourse, in a way we haven't yet seen, eventually supporting a demand for dramatic reform.

## A Legislative Seed Starts a Tree
* A 'compromise bill' slips through with enough restrictionist temptations (like more ICE funding or border infrastructure) to counterbalance 
a seemingly small expansionist concession, which dramatically impacts immigration.
Examples could include the following:
    * A path to legalization. 
    * A large-scale temporary worker program.
    * Protections for citizen children that would allow them to keep their parents.
    * Increased structural oversight of ICE or BP that would make the damage caused by them more documented and more apparent.

# Conclusion
The more I read of restrictionist books or listen to restrictionist podcasts, the more certain I am that they are fundamentally vulnerable to a compromised reform. Restrictionist rhetoric is caught in 
a contradictory position. On the one hand, they must simultaneously say that the status quo is disastrous and utterly unsustainable, but on the other hand forcefully oppose any idea of reform. This is why the phrase 
"comprehensive immigration reform", while being neutral on the surface, is widely understood on both sides of the issue to code immigration expansionism; if we change, we change in a way that allows more immigration.
In the restrictionist literature of the 80s and 90s, there were calls for new laws and new caps. Now, and especially in the popular restrictionisnt rhetoric, the talking point is to say that our current laws are fine, we only 
need someone "willing to enforce them". And this isn't a surprising conclusion

# Thank You and Farewell
Farewell for now, readers.
