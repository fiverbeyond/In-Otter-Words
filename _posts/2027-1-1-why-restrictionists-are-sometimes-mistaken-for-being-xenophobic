# Why Restrictionists are Sometimes Mistaken for Racists: A Case Study
## Tips for People who Argue for Immigration Restrictions

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists universally complain about being unfairly smeared with labels like 'racist'. I give
an example of why this mistake sometimes happens.

The fascinating and subtle relationship between restrictionism and racism is a topic worthy of a 
multi-volume book series. It's a topic that is little bit history, and a little bit rhetoric, and a little bit political demography.
In their media, restrictionists make it clear that they do not want to be associated with racism, and that they object to 
the label. Here are a few examples:

[^2] Brimelow, Peter. Alien Nation. Random House, 1995 1st Edition pg. 97

[^4] Sheehy, Daniel. Fighting Immigration Anarchy: American Patriots Battle to Save the Nation. Authorhouse. 2005. Pg. 11

In light of how often restrictionists feel the need to defend themselves here, I'd like to start this post by offering an olive branch --

Restrictionists, I don't think you are racists (at least the vast majority of you). I certainly don't think restrictionism as a whole
is fundamentally racist. I agree with you that you have often been unfairly accused of being racist, and sometimes I'm sure this
accusation is even just meant to distract from your real arguments. I also understand that this kind of name-calling can sometimes be hurtful.
You certainly don't see yourselves as racists, and (as some of you have pointed out), many of you are even representatives
of minority race groups in the U.S. So I can understand why you might be confused or insulted at being associated with racism.

I have several times read restrictionists express bewilderment
at why anybody would think your political position had any connection to racism. With that in mind, this blog post is meant 
to respond to this confusion, and give you an example so you can understand why, at least in some situtaions,
it might be easy to mistakenly connect restrictionism to racism. I'm not trying to excuse the childish behaviour 
of people who thoughtlessly throw slurs at you. I want to give any example of why sometimes this mix-up can be an honest mistake.

My example comes in the form of a guided tour, of sorts. Come with me, as we re-enact my personal experience...

## Reading "The Path to National Suicide"

"The Path to National Suicide" is a 1990 restrictionist pamphlet, written by Lawrence Auster, and published by the American Immigration Control
Foundation. It is referenced
by several other restrictionist books, and Lawrence Auster himself has been described as "the unsung godfather of the restrictionist movement."
The point is that this book is not a crazed screed by some unknown hack, but a respected and accepted addition to restrictionist literature.
As if to drive the point home, the book begins with the very same anti-racist declarations that other restrictionist books so often include.

[Quote the rejection of racism]

"This curious inhibition [to debate immigration] stems, of course, from a paralyzing fear of the charge of "racism."  The very manner in which 
the issue is framed -- as a matter of equal rights and the blessings of diversity on one side, versus "racism" on the other -- tends to cut off
all rational discourse on the subject."

So Mr. Auster shares the pains of modern restrictionists in being baselessly accused of racism. He even seems annoyed that the constan
charge of 'racism' should distract from the 'real' issues that restrictionists want to discuss.

Very well, then. An open-minded reader should not start with any assumption of a racial focus. They should feel comfortable reading through 
a pamphlet that, on its face, finally deals with the topic of immigration, independent from race.

### Lawrence Auster, Anti-Racist

Mr. Auster even includes clear anti-racist sentiments when he describes teh history of immigcration restrictions. He says "The new immigrantts, so differennt
in appearance and habits from the earlier Americans, had aroused profound fears never officially sanctioned, in the form of a racial ideology
that viewed the Nordic, or northern European, groups as superior to other Caucasian peoples."

Again, we can feel comforted that Mr. Auster recognizes (and openly calls out) the racism that motivated the resttrictions of the 1920s.
That ending phrase of "other Caucasian peoples" might seem a little old fashioned (why not "other races"?) but it doesn't detract from what
is clearly a censure of racially-motivated restrictionism.

And yet... for an anti-racist, whose restrictionism is not based in race, Mr. Auster might need to work on some phrasing. For example, after expressing
fears of America being subsumed by "Hispanic and Carribbean and Asian peoples", he says he wants 
"an honest debate between those who favor a radical change in America's ethnic and cultural identity, and those who think
this nation should preserve it's way of life, and its predominant European-American character."

'European-American'? This phrase would straightforwardly include Hispanic and Carribbean people, whose polity, culture, and ethnicity
clearly stem from a mix of European and American traditions. If these groups are "European-American", why would their inclusion pose a threat
to America's "European-American character"? This would be easily explainable if Mr. Auster means to use "European-American" as a shorthand for
racial characteristics... but he's already made it clear that his restrictionism is divorced from racial ideas. Maybe this was just awkward phrasing.

Then, later in the pamphlet, Auster bemoans the fact

"Erwin contended that the [1965] bill did not eliminate national and racial discrimination from our immigration law, but only instituted a new
form of discrimination against our traditional immigrant groups... In effect, we were replacing a sensible -- though admittedl9y too restrictive -- 
type of discrimination favoring our historic source nations and skilled persons, by a senseless type of discrimination favoring extended
families from Third-World countries."


## Chapter Three: On the Meaning of Racism

By now, apparently against its own wishes, this book is simply about race. Mr. Auster pauses his (ostensibly unrelated) defense of restrictionism
and instead talks about how the word 'racist' is used in modern society.

"As we all know by now, racism, like witchcraft, is a difficult accusation to defend oneself against. The reason is that the word no longer has 
a defined meaning.... "Racism" now apparently means anything that, in the view of black people, hurt their interests or offended them or, indeed, 
anything they did not approve of."

Now, there are undoubtedly many restrictionist readers who agree with Mr. Auster's understanding of race and racism... but this still
doesn't explain why it is so vital to expound on the topic in a book about restrictionism (which, again, has nothing to do with race, say restrictionists){.
But never mind; let's indulge Mr. Auster's diversion as we go deeper into the chapter. Mr. Auster makes a few
eyebrow-raising claims.

"But since America is [supposedly] inherrently racistt, it can never succeed in [becoming good]. It follows that America can only become a good 
country when it ceases to exist, i.e., when its European-rooted civilization is dismantled."

Truly, an apocalyptic vision! But... is this how we view other inherent vices? If America understands that politicians will always have a temptation
toward tyranny, does it follow that the entire American civilization must be dismantled? 

Auster cites (and then rejects) the definition of racism found in Webster's dictionary, and insists on a much higher bar for what should qualify as 
racism.

"As an attitude, we may say that that racism is contempt for members of a particular racial group becauseo of their alleged inferiority
or badness in relation to one's own group, or that racism consists of the inability to see any member of the other group as a fellow human being."

This is a childishly unworkable definition of racism. By this definition, slave-holders and slavers were largely not racist, since they clearly had the ability
to see at least *some* members of "the other group" as human beings. Ethno-nationalists who targetted a racial group for expulsion, persecution,
and even death, could discharge themselves of the accusation of racism (as an attitude) by simply admitting the humanity of those they
persecuted. Mr. Auster seems like an author completely unaware of how these groups spoke and acted, as if history were not jam-packed
with tyrants saying the phrase "We're all equal before God, but..." or 'benevolently' selecting special exceptions to their racial categories.
Since these regimes were clearly and proudly capable of seeing at least one member of the victim group as a human being, 
they avoid Mr. Auster's definition of racism.

And wasn't this book supposed to be about immigration?

Mr. Auster tightens his definition further...

"I would say further that the racist belief in another group's inferiority concerns their inherent worth as human beings,
not a mere difference in some particular trait or talent."

The unpracticed reader of restrictionism might be honestly confused at why this extended discussion of racism should be so central
a part of a book on immigration. But never fear... Auster will surely tie it all together in his wrap-up section, 
"Immigration and the Meaning of Racism". Let's hear how these two topics are connected!
