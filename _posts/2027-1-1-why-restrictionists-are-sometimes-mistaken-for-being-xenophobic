# Why Restrictionists are Sometimes Mistaken for Racists: A Case Study
## Tips for People who Argue for Immigration Restrictions

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists universally complain about being unfairly smeared with labels like 'racist'. I give
an example of why this mistake sometimes happens.

The fascinating and subtle relationship between restrictionism and racism is a topic worthy of a 
multi-volume book series. It's a topic that is little bit history, and a little bit rhetoric, and a little bit political demography.
In their media, restrictionists make it clear that they do not want to be associated with racism, and that they object to 
the label. Here are a few examples:

[^1] Hardin, Garrett. The Immigration Dilemma. Federation for American Immigration Reform, 1995.pg. 33

[^2] Brimelow, Peter. Alien Nation. Random House, 1995 1st Edition pg. 97

[^3] Tom Tancredo 'Race doesn't matter' interview.

[^4] Sheehy, Daniel. Fighting Immigration Anarchy: American Patriots Battle to Save the Nation. Authorhouse. 2005. Pg. 11

In light of how often restrictionists feel the need to defend themselves here, I'd like to start this post by offering an olive branch --

Restrictionists, I don't think you are racists (at least the vast majority of you). I certainly don't think restrictionism as a whole
is fundamentally racist. I agree with you that you have often been unfairly accused of being racist, and sometimes I'm sure this
accusation is even just meant to distract from your real arguments. I also understand that this kind of name-calling can sometimes be hurtful.
You certainly don't see yourselves as racists, and (as some of you have pointed out), many of you are even representatives
of minority race groups in the U.S. So I can understand why you might be confused or insulted at being associated with racism.

I have several times read restrictionists express bewilderment
at why anybody would think your political position had any connection to racism. With that in mind, this blog post is meant 
to respond to this confusion, and give you an example so you can understand why, at least in some situtaions,
it might be easy to mistakenly connect restrictionism to racism. I'm not trying to excuse the childish behaviour 
of people who thoughtlessly throw slurs at you. I want to give any example of why sometimes this mix-up can be an honest mistake.

My example comes in the form of a guided tour, of sorts. Come with me, as we re-enact my personal experience...

## Reading "The Path to National Suicide"

"The Path to National Suicide" is a 1990 restrictionist pamphlet, written by Lawrence Auster, and published by the American Immigration Control
Foundation. It is referenced
by several other restrictionist books, and Lawrence Auster himself has been described as "the unsung godfather of the restrictionist movement."
The point is that this book is not a crazed screed by some unknown hack, but a respected and accepted addition to restrictionist literature.
As if to drive the point home, the book begins with the very same anti-racist declarations that other restrictionist books so often include.
