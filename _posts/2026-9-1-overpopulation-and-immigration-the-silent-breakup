# Overpopulation and Restrictionism
## The Breakup that Nobody is Talking About

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionism used to be very closely tied to fears of overpopulation,
but recently the latter has become dramatically less popular.
With a bit of luck, the decline of "overpopulationism" will help discredit restrictionism as it goes.


There is shifting in the tide.

# "They used to be inseparable!"

I think people don't realize just how closely paired restrictionists and populationists have been. 
FAIR, the most prominent restrictionist lobby group, still recommends multiple population-based books on its official reading list (like "The Population Fix" and "The Case for Fewer People").
The Center for Immigration Studies, the most prominent restrictionist think tank, also has some "overpopulation classics" on 
its reading list (like "Thirty Million Texans?"). The most obvious example of the intermarriage would be NumbersUSA,  a restrictionist organization
explicitly devoted to slowing population growth in the U.S.

Restrictionism and 'populationism' have some natural synergies. They both rely heavily on fears of an imminent catastrophe. They can also both make use of 


# The Sea Change

Modern restrictionism is different. First let's take a look at some modern popular 'casual restrictionists'. These figures may not advocate particularly hard for restrictionism,
but all of them have taken clear public restrictionist stances. What's changed is that instead of fearing the supposed utter destruction of an overpopulation crisis, they fear
America's "plummetting birthrates".

But the shift doesn't stop with individual speakers. The younger, fresher organizations have shifted as well.
PragerU doesn't often comment on immigration, but when they do, they take a decidedly restrictionist stance. Evenso, they recently
put out a video arguing against the fears of overpopulation.
