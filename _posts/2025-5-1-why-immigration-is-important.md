# Why Immigration Is Important

>**_The Short Stuff:_** U.S. immigration policy is, from a humanistic perspective, one of the most important
problems for our nation. It currently causes a tremendous amount of suffering, and it has the potential to
dramatically improve tens of millions of lives.

Restrictionism has many powerful rhetorical tools at its disposal, and one such tool is an appeal to dire consequences.
Even with all the objections I have with respect to our immigration restrictions, I would never argue that our immigration 
restrictions put our nation on the verge of total destruction. Restrictionists, on the other hand, very often believe that our
immigration restrictions are the only thing standing between America and an abyss of economic and cultural catastrophe. These fears aren't rational, but they are potent, popular, and invigorating.

I think one side effect of this difference is that expansionists (people who are in favor of allowing more legal immigration into the country) don't have as much reason to take up immigration reform as a cause. Add to this the fact that immigration reform would benefit immigrants substantially more than citizens, and you can see why advocating against restrictionism is
an uphill climb. 

This post is meant to address this disparity, by offering reasons why immigration reform is a worthwhile, vitally
important national policy. A life spent advocating for immigration reform would be a lafe spent having
a powerful positive impact on the world.

## Our restrictions currently cause a tremendous amount of suffering.


Illegal immigration is the sort of crime that invites an infinite array of punishments meant to make life harder for people.
From drivers' licenses to airplane travel, these laws strip basic social abilities from workers that we don't even demand from 
ex-convicts. 

Modern restrictionism basically views deportation as the only possible 'redeeming punishment' for illegal immigration and despite what restrictionists claim, deportation is not a harmless punishment. It breaks families, 
To use a fancy term, it "deracinates", stripping the individual of their home, their community, their friends,
and yes, even their culture (many unauthorized immigrants are much more attached to the culture of America than to 
whatever country they are deported to.) Deportations commonly ruin lives, and the victims of deportation frequently
compare it to having a limb caught off, or being imprisoned for long periods of time. Thanks to our restrictions, the government carries out hundreds of thousands of them each year.


Then there are more victims of our immigrartion system. Contrary to what restrictionists claim, it is actually our restrictions, not our legal immigration, that fuels
the horrors of human smuggling. With the threat of deportation hanging over them, immigrant families
are often entirely in the power of their traffickers or employers. The blame for these horrific abuses 
lies rightfully with the smugglers themselves, but the policy that empowers them is our demand for money and status
in exchange for a travel visa. Our restrictions empower the drug cartels that make their money from trafficking.


## Our restrictions stop millions of lives from being much, much better.

It's very difficult to gauge exactly how many people would move to America if they were legally allowed, but even conservative estimates seem to suggest another two or three million could immigrate each year. For these two or three million, life would likely change in a dramatic fashion.
When low-skill immigrants move to the U.S., their lives change dramatically for the better [cite the statistic]. It's typical for their wages to go up by a factor of two or three. The United States is also almost always safer for immigrants than the counries they are leaving. 

Moving on to even more meaningful life improvements

Moving to the U.S. lets these people
experience the rights and values that America has always stood for. I would argue that these rights are of more worth than all the other benefits combined.
Finally (and I would argue most importantly of all), for many would-be immigrants, being allowed to come to the United States would let them live together with their families. This is a benefit 

But it's possible that the greatest benefit of immigration wouldn't even be to teh immigrants, but instead to their families who they support through remittances. Over 100 million people in the world rely chiefly on remittances from the U.S. for their income [cite this]. If more people were allowed to immigrate, they would undoubtedly send millions more to the neediest people in the world. It's important to note that this is not a fiscal expense on the part of the U.S. taxpayer, but rather a transfer of earned income. In other words, this isn't a request for United States citizens to part with their own money out of charity, but rather just to allow for others to *earn* wages, through their own hard labor, that can improve tens of millions the world over.


##  The solutions to our problem only politically difficult, not morally or logistically difficult.

Modern medicine is logistically difficult: it may be clear that it's good to heal the sick, but research is a long and painstaking process, and medical procedures can be extremely expensive.

Our criminal justice system is morally difficult. The mechanics of incarceration are not much of a mystery, but the right way to apply these things is fraught with difficult moral choices.

Immigration reform is neither morally nor logistically difficult. It doesn't require a complex new apparatus (in fact, it's our current immigration system that is overly complex), and the morality is clear (setting aside the hideously overblown sense of nativism that restrictionists profess). Of all U.S. policies, immigration reform has the clear ability to dramatically improve the wellbeing of millions upon millions of people. The only political outcome that can rival this kind of positive impact would be the use of U.S. military to avoid a serious global or regional conflict. Not even all U.S. foreign aid, combined with all private charity from U.S. citizens, can rival the size of impact that immigration reform can have. A citizen who, early in their life, decided to never give one penny to any charitable cause, but at the same time allowed a few more immigrant families to move to the U.S., would have a much bigger positive impact on the world.

With so much at stake, it is a tragedy that our immigration discourse is so lost in the weeds, and so far removed from actual moral discussion. And with a bit of effort, over time, we can change that.
