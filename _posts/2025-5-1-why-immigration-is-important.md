# Why Immigration Is Important

>**_The Short Stuff:_** U.S. immigration policy is, from a humanistic perspective, one of the most important
problems of our day. It currently causes a tremendous amount of suffering, and it has the potential to
dramatically improve tens of millions of lives.

## Our restrictions currently cause a tremendous amount of suffering.


Despite what restrictionists claim, deportation is not a harmless punishment. It breaks families, 
To use a fancy term, it "deracinates", stripping the individual of their home, their community, their friends,
and yes, even their culture (many unauthorized immigrants are much more attached to the culture of America than to 
whatever country they are deported to.) Deportations commonly ruin lives, and the victims of deportation frequently
compare it to having a limb caught off, or being imprisoned for long periods of time.

And thanks to our restrictions, the government carries out hundreds of thousands of them each year.


Contrary to what restrictionists claim, it is actually our restrictions, not our legal immigration, that fuels
the horrors of human smuggling. With the threat of deportation hanging over them, immigrant families
are entirely in the power of their traffickers or employers. The blame for these horrific abuses 
lies rightfully with the smugglers themselves, but the policy that empowers them is our demand for money and status
in exchange for a travel visa. Our restrictions empower the drug cartels that make their money from trafficking.


## Our restrictions stop millions of lives from being much, much better.

When low-skill immigrants move to the U.S., their lives change dramatically for the better. It's typical for their wages to go up by a factor of two or three.

Most importantly (and most damningly to those restrictionists who want to keep these people out forever), moving to the U.S. lets these people
experience the rights and values that America has always stood for. I would argue that these rights are of more worth than all the other benefits combined.


##  The solutions to our problem only politically difficult, not morally or logistically difficult.

Modern medicine is logistically difficult. 
Our criminal justice system is morally difficult. It may be
