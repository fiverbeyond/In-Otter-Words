# Five Awful Books Recommended by FAIR
## I'd be ashamed of myself if I let these slide.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** FAIR, a prominent restrictionist organization, keeps a list of reading recommendations.
These are the worst stinkers from that list.


Now that I've taken the pains to read all of FAIR's recommended literature and even recommended some of the books they promote,
I can't bear to move on to a new topic without taking the opportunity to publicly shame FAIR for their taste in books.



## 5 - In Mortal Peril

In Mortal Peril serves as a stand-in for a good dozen or so "bog-standard" restrictionist books. Once you've read a few of these, you see the pattern.
Gather up some news reports of immigrant murderers, throw in some 'terrorist watchlist' references.
"In Mortal Peril" gets to be the representative of this boilerplate, only because its title is so funny.

## 2 - Alien Nation by Peter Brimelow

Author Peter Brimelow comes off as a perfectly respectable, cultured, and intellectual restrictionist. An immigrant himself, he was a well-respected speaker in the 1990s, making frequent
appearances on TV programs and high-profile debates.

But in "Alien Nation", Brimelow's views are simply detestable. The focal point of "Alien Nation" rests almost entirely on the then-distant prediction that the United States was going to become
a majority-minority nation with respect to race: white people would be in the minority. Mr. Brimelow treats this outcome as a disaster, and the end of America. 
He makes it clear through his arguments that he sees the essence of America's nationhood as deeply, fundamentally, white. 

There's no way around it: this book advocates for white nationalism. It doesn't belong on any respectable list of restrictionist literature,
no matter how well-spoken or well-educated the author was. I'm sure that Mr. Brimelow doesn't see himself as a white nationalist, but that's
because by his own admission, he doesn't know what the term means. Where did he say this? In a chummy one-on-one podcast interview
with self descride "white advocate" and founder of the white supremacist organization American Renaissance, Jared Taylor.

But even explicit white nationalism is not the worst on offer on FAIR's recommended list.
Your opinion may differ, but for my part, the worst of the worst goes to...

## 1 - The Immigration Dilemma

## Honorable Mention: The Camp of the Saints

For those who are thankfully unaware, The Camp of the Saints is an infamously vile novel.
I've described it as "Surprisingly similar to a zombie apocalypse story, except instead of zombies, brown people."
It imagines a future crisis where a million foreigners from Africa commandeer a fleet of ships, intent on landing in Europe.
In what the novel depicts as a natural consequence, the immigrants' arrival on the shores of France immediately results
in complete apocalypse, leaving Europe literally in ruins. The Camp of the Saints is widely understood to be deeply 
racist and xenophobic propaganda.

"But wait!", says the observant observer, "That book isn't even *on* FAIR's list of recommended readings."
And indeed, to be fair to FAIR, it isn't. Instead, the book is recommended by the books FAIR recommends.
