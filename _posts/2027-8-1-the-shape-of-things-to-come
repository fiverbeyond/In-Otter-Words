>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionist media is a hotbed of doomsday predictions. Here are some that will soon be upon us, so they say!


2035 - Europe becomes majority Muslim.

2028 - Social Security collapses (unless immigration is drastically cut in the early 2000s).

2040s - America ceases to be 'America', because it is a majority-minority country (Alien Nation).

2050 - Europe is no longer Europe (Douglas Murray).

2050 - (The Case for Fewer People) says there will be a complete population disaster if U.S. population reaches 400 million.

2050 - (The Case for Fewer People) Beck says that without immediate, dramatic immigration cuts, U.S. population reaches 550 million.
