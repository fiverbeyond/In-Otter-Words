>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionist media is a hotbed of doomsday predictions. Here are some that will soon be upon us, so they say!

Things that will soon come to pass (according to restrictionists).

### 2028 - Social Security collapses (unless immigration is drastically cut in the early 2000s).[^ankarlo_on_social_security]

### 2035 - Europe becomes majority Muslim.[^federer_majority_muslim] (Bill Federer)

### 2035 - Cuban descendants in Miami are still not assimilated into America. [^lamm_on_cuban_americans] (Richard Lamm)

### 2040s - America undergoes a distrous and profound "ethnic revolution", as it becomes a majority-minority country (Alien Nation).[^brimelow_on_majority]

### 2040s - Thanks to immigration, boomers have lived their lives without ever enjoying a stabilized country.[^ankarlo_on_boomers] (NumbersUSA.com)

### 2050 - Europe ceases to be Europe (Douglas Murray).[^murray_end_of_europe]

### 2050 - There will be a complete population disaster if the U.S. population reaches 400 million around this time. (Donald Mann) [^mann_complete_disaster]

### 2050 - U.S. population could reach 550 million, unless drastic immigration cuts are put into place (in the early 2000s).[^simcox_on_population]

[^ankarlo_on_social_security]:Ankarlo, Dan. Illegals: The Unacceptable Cost of American’s Failure to Control Its Borders. Thomas Nelson, 2010, pg. 279
"The cost to U.S. taxpayers will be dramatic as illegals reach retirement age in large numbers in about twenty years. They will use Social Security, SSI,
Medicare, and Medicaid while having paid little or nothing into teh system under any proposed amnesty or earned citizenship program, with an 
approximate cost of $2.5 trillion just as the Social Security program goes bankrupt."

[^ankarlo_on_boomers]: Ankarlo, Dan. Illegals: The Unacceptable Cost of American’s Failure to Control Its Borders. Thomas Nelson, 2010, pg. 279 (quoting NumbersUSA)
"The immigration tidal wave of the last three decades has made it impossible for Baby Boomers ever to enjoy the 1970s dream of a stabilized
country -- even if all immigration were stopped tomorrow." (To be clear, I think in context, by "stabilized country" NumbersUSA means that the population is no longer growing.
This makes the quote an even more laughable sentiment.)

[^federer_majority_muslim]:
"They're seeing this demographic change. In many Muslim cultures it's a social stigma to have less than five children, and so you'll have these women
with lots of children, and **they estimate that within the next ten years, Europe will become Islamic** the same way that-- people forget
that all of North Africa used to be Christian."

[^lamm_on_cuban_americans]: [Still need to find this] Lamm, Richard D, and Gary Imhoff. The Immigration Time Bomb. Dutton Adult, 1985.

[^brimelow_on_majority]:Brimelow, Peter. Alien Nation. Random House, 1995 1st Edition, pg. 62., pg. 99
Brimelow's book focuses strongly on this predictlion repeatedly treats this outcome as a disaster that threaten's America's fundamental identity.

[^murray_end_of_europe]: Murray, Douglas. The Strange Death of Europe. Bloomsbury Continuum. 2017. [Check Edition], pg. 309-310
"By the middle of this century, while China will probably still look like China, India will probably still look like India... Western Europe will at best
resemble a large-scale version of the United Nations... This place where international cities develop into something resembling international countries will be many 
things. But it will not be Europe any more."

[^mann_complete_disaster]: Mann, Donald, “The Case for Reducing Immigration from over One Million to 100,000 a Year.” The Case for Fewer People. Edited by Lindsey Grant, Seven Locks Press, 24 June, 2006, pg. 392
"Projection A [placing U.S. population at just under 400M by 2050] - The only comment possible is a simple one. This line leads straight to disaster." On the previous page, Mann says the only way 
to reverse the "disastrous" growth of population is to cut our immigration rate by 90%.

[^simcox_on_population]: Simcox, David, “Amnesty: Overpopulation by Fiat” The Case for Fewer People. Edited by Lindsey Grant, Seven Locks Press, 24 June, 2006, pg. 392
Admittedly, Simcox does soften this prediction with a 'could'. "The higher fertility of these added legal residents and their families, and the resulting millions of new migration
chains have the potential to accelerate America's population growth to the "highest" and, until now, "least likely" level projected by the Census Bureau. Immigration-fed
population momentum could produce a U.S. population of 550 million by mid-century, reaching the one billion mark in the 2080s."
