# Words We Use: "Immigrant" or "Alien"
## Why I choose to use 'Immigrant' rather than 'Alien'

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists continually emphasize how important it is to use the word 'alien' when talking about immigrants. They claim that 'alien' 
is the only legally correct term, and that we should use official legal terms when talking about public policy. Both of these ideas are nonsense,
and restrictionists instantly abandon their proposed standard when put to the test.

Political argument is often like a cluster of kindergarteners huddled around a dictionary with crayons, scrambling to cross out definitions they don't like. I trust I don't need to give any examples: anybody who has taken any position on a divisive issue (even a middle-of-the-road position) will be familiar with the 'special words' coded for one stance or another.

So... "immigrant" or "alien"? Which term should we use to describe people who immigrate illegally?
Let's hear the arguments for the side of "alien".

"The reason I use the term 'illegal alien' or 'alien unlawfully present in the United States' is those are the terms used by Federal law. and being a lawyer, I try to use the terms used by law."[^1]

"Dominant media outlets use the euphemism 'undocumented', but the official U.S. government term, used in Federal statutes, is 'illegal alien': an unlawful entrant who came without permission and stays in open defiance of our laws."[^malkin]

"It is important to note that [leftists] specifically avoid using the word alien, which is the terminology used in Federal law. To be clear, 'alien' is not a negative or perjorative term. It is a legal term of art."[^sullivan]


Restrictionist voices seem very consistent here. In a united voice, I think they clearly make three claims about their usage of 'alien'.
1) 'Alien' is preferred over 'immigrant' because between the two terms, 'alien' is the one used in Federal law.
2) When discussing policy, we should generally use the same legal terms as are used in Federal law.
3) There's nothing perjorative about using 'alien'.

Let's examine these claims one by one.

## Claim #1: 'Alien' is the only correct legal term used in Federal law.

This is simply false. The same section of the U.S. legal code that defines "alien" also defines "immigrant", and uses the term "immigrant" several times. [Citation] "Immigrant" is actually
the more specific term; in law, all immigrants are aliens, but not all aliens are immigrants. This is different from how these terms are used in common parlance, where
a naturalized citizen would still be recognized as an "immigrant" by most people.

[Cite the statute - "Alien"]
[Cite the statute - "Immigrant"]

# Claim 2: We should only use official legal terms when discussing public policy.

This sounds like an appeal to clarity and exactness, but it falls apart when you think about it for a bit. Legalese is obviously necessary and important when writing court documents, but only pedants would push for its use in all 
policy discussions. Restrictionists certainly don't confine themselves to legal terms when talking about immigration.

But let me be quick to agree with restrictionists where I can: there are certain times when restrictionists are not talking about immigrants per se, but rather foreigners in general. For example, many smugglers who operate on the border between Mexico and the United States aren't "immigrants" under the dictionary definition, because they don't intend to settle permanently in the United States. In these cases, saying "alien" is more technically correct than "immigrant", although I woul9d also point out that "foreign national" would do just as well.

# Claim #3: There's nothing perjorative about the word "alien". 

This claim is easily disproven by observing restrictionists' own behaviour. Overwhelmingly, restrictionist speakers show a clear double-standard when it comes to their use of the word "alien". They appeal to legal exactness to justify their use of the word toward unauthorized immigrants, but they instantly abandon this standard when it comes to foreigners who they personally approve of.  I have never yet, in text, video, or conversation, heard a restrictionist refer to their own immigrant ancestors as "aliens".

This pattern of behaviour should be so obvious that it's not worth listing evidence of this double standard, but here are a few examples:

[Koblach] 

[Charlie Kirk] - What's especially fascinating about this example is that the student, since she was present on an F-type visa, *was not even an immigrant*, neither by [cite the statute], nor by the dictionary definition. It should come as no surprise that Mr. Kirk didn't use "alien" to refer to her... because "alien" is an impolite, perjorative term (and Mr. Kirk evidently understands this).


That's not to say there aren't half-hearted attempts at consistency here and there. Restrictionist lobbying organizations (like the Center for Immigration Studies or 
F.A.I.R.) do sometimes make a point to use the term "alien" when talking about legal residents or other foreigners, and I give them credit for standing by this standard
to at least some degree. But even these sources show a clear bias. If you do a search for the terms "legal immigrant" or "legal alien" on their respective websites, you can see an overwhelming tendency to use "alien" when talking about unauthorized immmigrants, but switch to "immigrant" when talking about any other foreigner.

# Conclusion

The double-standard applied by restrictionists is evidence enough: in casual speech, 'alien' is an othering, derogatory term, and restrictionists know it. Their claim that they use this term out of sense of legal exactness isn't just childishly pedantic, it's outright false; it conveniently ignores the definition of 
"immigrant", and they fail to follow their supposed standard when they talk about foreigners they approve of.
