# Words We Use: "Immigrant" or "Alien"
## Why I choose to use 'Immigrant' rather than 'Alien'

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists continually emphasize how important it is to use the word 'alien' when talking about immigrants. They claim that 'alien' 
is the only legally correct term, and that we should use official legal terms when talking about public policy. Both of these ideas are nonsense,
and restrictionists instantly abandon their proposed standard when put to the test.

Political argument is often like a cluster of kindergarteners huddled around a dictionary with crayons, scrambling to cross out definitions they don't like. I trust I don't need to give any examples: anybody who has taken any position on a divisive issue (even a middle-of-the-road position) will be familiar with the 'special words' coded for one stance or another.

So... "immigrant" or "alien": which term should we use to describe people who immigrate illegally?
Let's hear the arguments for the side of "alien".

# Claim #1: 'Alien' is the only correct legal term.

This is simply false. The same section of the U.S. legal code also includes a definition for "immigrant", and uses the term "immigrant" several times in the code. [Citation] "Immigrant" is actually
the more specific term; in the law code, all immigrants are aliens, but not all aliens are immigrants. This is different from how these terms are used in common parlance, where
a naturalized citizen would still be recognized as an "immigrant" by most people.

# Claim 2: We should only use official legal terms when discussing public policy.

This idea sounds like you're being exact, but it falls apart when you think about it for two seconds. Legalese is obviously necessary and important when writing court documents, but only pedants would 


# Restrictionists show a clear double standard, and switch away from 'alien' when talking about any foreigner they approve of. 



     That's not to say there aren't half-hearted attempts at consistency here and there. Restrictionist lobbying organizations (like the Center for Immigration Studies or 
     F.A.I.R.) do sometimes make a point to use the term "alien" when talking about legal residents or other foreigners, and I give them credit for standing by this standard
     to at least some degree. But even these sources show a clear bias. If you do a search for the terms "legal immigrant" or "legal alien" on their respective websites

# Conclusion

The double-standard applied by restrictionists is evidence enough: in casual speech, 'alien' is an othering, derogatory term, and restrictionists know it.
Their claim that they use this term out of sense of legal exactness isn't just childishly pedantic, it's outright false; it conveniently ignores the definition of 
"immigrant", and they fail to follow their supposed standard when they talk about foreigners they approve of.
