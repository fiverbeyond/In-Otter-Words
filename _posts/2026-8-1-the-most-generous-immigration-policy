# Does the United States have the most generous immigration policy?
## 

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Complacent American citizens sometimes justify our restrictions by 
claiming that America already has the most generous immigration policy in the world. There's a kernel of truth
in this idea, but it ignores the reality of modern global immigration.

## Restrictionists Say the U.S. has the Most Generous Immigration Policy on Earth

First, let's establish that this is a common refrain in restrictionist circles:



Michelle Malkin says the U.S. has "The Most Generous immigration policies in the world."[^5]



## So... is this true?

No, it's not, but there's one aspect of it that's true. What's true is that the United States accepts more immigrants than any 
other nation. But the United States is the third largest country in the world: if every country exchanged immigrants
at the same rate (or as restrictionists might say, the same 'generosity'), it would still be third from the top. 

No, if comparing immigration rates is meant to be meaningful at all, it's the per-capita rate that we should look at,
and looking at per-capita rates, the United States falls far behind other nations. 

[Cite pre-capita immigration rate]

Another meaningful metric might be to look at the percentage of foreign-born.

[The U.S.: A Very Restricted Immigration System]

If restrictionists insist that raw numbers should be used to measure, the the United States would just as easily be said to have the 
"most retrictive" and "most cruel" immigration policy in the world, because the United States rejects more visa applications than any other country.
It also deports more people than any other country. This can be established simply by pointing out how few people are deported by India and China
(the only countries with a higher population than the United States). 

At this point, a restrictionist might agree that the per-capita rate would be a better way of measuring how restrictive the
United States is, but this doesn't bode well either. 

No matter how you slice it, the United State's current immigration policy is remarkably restricted by world standards. The United States
spends more money punishing illegal immigrants than any other country by far, and it rejects a higher percentage of visa applications.
By world standards, the United States is a particularly difficult country to immigrate to, at least legally. 
Restrictionists cannot excuse the harshness of their policies by pretending our nation is particularly generous.
