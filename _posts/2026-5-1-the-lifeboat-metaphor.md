# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #3 : The Lifeboat Analogy
## Allowing more immigration is not like letting a lifeboat get swamped.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** One of the most popular metaphors used in discussing immigration is that of a lifeboat on the verge of capsizing.
Restrictionists say that letting more immigrants in risks capsizing the nation, killing everyone. This is a dumb idea.

Browsing through restrictionist metaphors brings a strange delight. This blog has already addressed [the gumball analogy], and Aldo Buttazonni's [Halloween analogy], and one day, I plan to dive gleefully into what I consider the crown jewel of restrictionst metaphors: "Letting someone into your country is like letting someone into your house."

Today I address one of the great classics in the field, Garret Hardin's "Lifeboat Metaphor". This was one of the first metaphors I ever heard for exploring the ethics of restrictionism. Even the popular educational channel Crash Course explored it in their series on ethics (and I heartily recommend that readers give the video a quick watch). It's made the rounds since it was first introduced in the seventies.

In this post, I intend to explain the metaphor and show a few implications that, in my opinion, suggest it's a bad analogy for reality.
In later follow-up post, I will detail the reasons behind why I reject the analogy, following my preferred three-step approach to
[dissolving an analogy].

## The Lifeboat Analogy

Let's have Mr. Garrett Hardin

The lifeboat analogy goes like so. Imagine that you are on a lifeboat after a recent shipwreck. Around you in the water are swarms of other shipwreck survivors, swimming toward your lifeboat in the hopes of climbing aboard and saving their own lives. But the lifeboat can only hold so many people: if too many people attempt to climb on board, the boat will swamp and capsize, leaving everyone in the water. The conclusion that the analogy offers is that the occupants of the lifeboat are therefore justified in denying entry to swimmers.

Lifeboat - The United States
Lifeboat occupants - U.S. citizens.
Swimmers - Immigrants
Capsize - The catastrophe of overpopulation.

## The Ethics the Lifeboat is Appealing To

It's important to point out that, in steel-man form, I agree with the basic ethics of the lifeboat scenario. If I was in a lifeboat clearly filled to capacity, and I could be reasonably certain of impending capsize, it would be morally permissible to deny entry to swarms of swimmers. The mechanics here are truly horrifying: it could be done by rowing away and leaving the stragglers to their deaths, by shoving them off with oars, or even shooting them as they approach. It's a ghastly idea, but if the only alternative were a complete capsize (leading to the death of all the survivors already in the lifeboat) it would be morally required. As usual with utilitarianism, the pill is bitter, but for me, the morality holds up under inspection.

## Showing the Analogy is Flawed

# The lifeboat analogy straightforwardly justifies expelling U.S. citizens from their homeland.

As we'll discuss later, people who propose the lifeboat analogy wisely keep far away from actually giving a carrying-capacity of the United States. The analogy mongers its fear just by the assurance that whatever the 'tipping point' is, we must be very close to it, and crossing it
will certainly lead to utter destruction.

But if you hand-wave away the need for actual reasonable estimates of that tipping point, the lifeboat analogy suddenly
justifies *any* action that excludes people from the lifeboat. You could be sitting alone in 
a lifeboat the size of a yacht, and still be justified in stopping anybody from joining you (after all, 
you don't know the exact carrying capacity of the lifeboat. Therefore, says the analogy, you are 
justified in stopping anybody from joining you). But why stop there? As long as we're agreeing to turn a blind
eye to actually measuring any tipping point, then we must admit that it could be the case that the lifeboat is
already overpopulated, and the only way to guarantee our safety is to begin tossing people overboard.
There's no reason, within the lifeboat analogy, to not begin choosing citizen minorities to expel from
the lifeboat (since the presence of any such minority threatens the deaths of everyone in the nation). 
Thus, not only would the federal government be justified in stripping millions of their citizenship
and deporting them, but they are *morally obligated* to do so.

And it gets worse than that. Since the lifeboat analogy eschews any strict measure of overpopulation, this violent expulsion would be justified, even for the majority of citizens. As long as *any* citizen still lived in the U.S., the government is morally obligated to expel other citizens (because every citizen in the nation threatens tip the nation into its capsize mechanic, killing everyone else).

# History shows us that the lifeboat analogy is nonsense

As with so many restrictionist talking points, the lifeboat analogy falls apart when applied to any other kind of migration aside from transnational migration. Take migration between U.S. states, for example. For most of U.S. history, the states have had open borders, allowing completely free movement between them. If the lifeboat analogy were a close description of reality, we should have seen many of these state capsize: not just 'an economic downturn', but a full-blown event of utter destruction, where the population of the state reached its 'tipping point', and suddenly everyone in the state becomes equally destitute.
This doesn't happen.

The same is true for migration between counties or cities. One could even defend a bold claim here: in the entire history of the U.S., from the hundreds of cities and counties that have existed, *not one* of them has ever 'capsized' in the way the lifeboat analogy suggests. Yes, some towns go bankrupt, and some indusries collapse, but not a single example here has all the traits that are vital to the lifeboat metaphor, namely:
 * The disaster is triggered strictly by overpopulation
 * The disaster is sudden.
 * The disaster results in the complete destitution of everyone in the city (the 'lifeboat').

In all of the local examples, most people can immediately see how silly the lifeboat comparison is.  Those who push the lifeboat analogy as a good metaphor for
international migration need to explain why the analogy fails for every kind of bordered government, with the single proposed exception of sovereign nation-states. 
What is it about national borders that make a capsize event utterly unavoidable in their case, but make it practically unimaginable in the case
of states, cities, neighborhoods, etc?

Even if you could come up with a meaningful explanation for this, the history of nation states itself is strong evidence against the lifeboat metaphor. 
The nations within the Schengen Area have shared open borders with each other for decades: twenty-nine "lifeboats" that have,
according to the metaphor, doomed themselves to be upended.

# Countering Some Defenses

#1. "Ah, but we *have* seen examples of cities, states, or EU members capsizing from too much citizen migration. [Cites the Greek debt crisis, Chicago's slums, or Texas's budget imbalance]."

But the second reason is more important: even if every example of a fiscal crisis in America was due solely to citizen migration, 
these examples would still be nowhere near the kind of utter devastation described by the capsize mechanic. Remeber that the whole point of
the lifeboat metaphor is that reaching the moment of capsize results in total destruction [Quote restrictionist examples here].
