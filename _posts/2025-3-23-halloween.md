# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #1
## Unauthorized immigrants are not like parents who steal candy from children.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Aldo Buttazonni says that unauthorized immigrants are like parents who steal Halloween candy, but this metaphor doesn't make any sense when you think about it. It turns out to be simple prejudiced smearing
> with no ethical substance.

Happy Halloween season, my fellow dark spirits! It's that blustery time of year when we suddenly become interested in gourds and make other preparations for that most bizarre and cathartic of our holidays.
And what could be more cathartic than examining a Halloween-themed take on illegal immigration? 

Today, we examine [a classic video post by Aldo Buttazonni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JLs801zAEI), who frequently advocates for restrictionism. Aldo's video focuses on some porch-camera footage, from someone who left a bowl of treats with a sign on their front porch for trick-or-treater children. In the video, we see a group of parents greedily taking all of the candy from
the bowl, leaving nothing for future trick-or-treaters. Assuming there's not some kind of misunderstanding going on, I'm sure most people would be disgusted by these actions. 
You might find it hard to 
make a connection to illegal immigration, but don't worry, Mr. Buttazonni makes the connection!

### Dissolving the Analogy (a How-To)

Restrictionist and nativist talking points have always relied on some popular, but questionable metaphors, from "A nation is like a house" to "Our lifeboat is about to capsize", and even "Get in line!" When responding to these metaphors, I like to follow my personal strategy for dissolving an analogy [cite my smaller blog post here].

#### 1. Clarify the analogy.
#### 2. Point out the relevant distinctions.
#### 3. Prove the relevance of the distinctions by saying that if they were resolved, I would agree with the analogy.

So, let's apply thes steps to Aldo's comparison.

### Step One: Clarify the Analogy

Let's recall what Aldo says about his metaphor.

![image alt](/assets/img/headshots/AldoButtazonni.png){: .right } > **Aldo Markdown:** I  think it's a very good metaphor for what's happening at our southern border. You have this group of people that put out this bowl of candy... a high-trust society... and immedi ately you have these people that are capitalizing and taking advantage of what's going on here... People made the analogy that the bowl is our social services."  (1:55)

Okay, so in Aldo's analogy, the citizens of the U.S. are the homeowners, putting out the bowl of candy (social services), and the thieving parents are the unauthorized immigrants, taking all the candy for
themselves and leaving none for the rightful recipients: the trick-or-treating children. And in this analogy, who are the trick-or-treating children who *should* be getting the candy? 
Mr. Buttazoni explains...

> **Aldo:** We have a society that we want to be high-trust in, but it's hard to do that when you have millions of illegal immigrants coming in here every year
> and taking advantage of the services that should be reserved for Americans. (2:30)

Got it. So the rough analogy looks something like this:

  | The Target  | The Source  |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Homeowners  | U.S. Taxpayers|
  | Bowl   | Social Services        |
  | Thieves | Unauthorized Immigrants |
  | Children | U.S. Citizens |

A clean metaphor that paints unauthorized immigrants with the same disgust we would hold for these parents who steal candy from children. 

But what happens if you think about this for a bit?

### Step Two: Identify the Distinctions

I see many meaningful differences between the situation Aldo describes, and what is happening with illegal immigration in America.

#### 1. Adults are not the intended recipients of the candy, but taxpayers are the intended recipients of social services.
##### This includes unauthorized immigrants.

Aldo Buttazonni may object to state and local governments including unauthorized immigrants
as intended recipients, but that doesn't mean it never happens. To fit the analogy, this would be like a homeowner
putting candy out, but explicitly allowing all children in the neighborhood to take a piece (not just the children who, say, were 
born in the neighborhood).

#### 2. The parents in the video are taking many times more than is allowed to each child,
##### but immigrants don't 'take' many times the amount of social services that citizens do.

Immigrants on average use fewer benefits than U.S. citizens [^immigrant-social]. Although I personally haven't seen any
study that specifically looks at the services used by unauthorized immigrants, it is almost certain that they likewise
use services at lower rates than U.S. citizens (since they are barred from many more services than
even authorized immigrants are). It's childishly silly to pretend that the average authorized immigrant is
 consuming four or five times as much in services as the average citizen, but that's what Mr. Buttazoni's metaphor demands.

#### 3. The parents in the video are leaving nothing behind for future trick-or-treaters.

...but unauthorized immigrants aren't leaving social services 'empty' for citizens. Despite what restrictionists say,
for the vast majority of social services, providing the service to unauthorized immigrants does not mean citizens go without.
From time to time, I ask restrictionists for examples of state-funded programs that offer some kind of service to unauthorized immigrants
which is barred to citizens.

#### 4. Adults have more agency than children, but unauthorized immigrants do not have more agency than native citizenns.

In Aldo's Halloween example, we hold the adults to a higher standard because they are obviously more mentally and emotionally developed than their children, and therefore are more morally accountable. Following Aldo's analogy, this would mean that unauthorized immigrants are similarly much more mature and self-aware than native U.S. citizens.  This distinction may not apply here; it's possible that Mr. Buttazonni would express just as much disgust at children behaving this way as adults (he doesn't clarify this point). It's still worth bringing up, because this important difference certainly adds to our natural disgust at the adults' behaviour.


### Step Three: The Proofs

Now it's time for me to stand by my words, and openly agree with the analogy... if its differences were resolved.
First, let's imagine that we lived in a nation where all benefits were explicitly limited to U.S. citizens, including all state benefits.
In this case, immigrants who took these resources would be stealing.
Next, let's add the second difference, where immigrants generally took many times the amount of public support that U.S. citizens do. For example, let's imagine that
unauthorized immigrants typically took five or ten times the number of public resources as your average citizen (just as the adults in Aldo's video do).
Now the third difference: let us imagine that most of these public resources were measurably finite, and that, once 'raided' by unauthorized immigrants, the public 
resources were then gone, leaving many citizens without any access at all. For example, we would need to imagine that, once immigrants had taken their five-fold share of
food stamps, many deserving native-born U.S. citizens must explicitly do without (and we would need to say that the same would be true for medical care, education costs, etc).
And finally, the fourth difference: let us imagine that unauthorized immigrants are, on the whole, much more mature and morally responsible than U.S. citizens (who are like children
in comparison). A bizarre idea, but let's imagen that the U.S. was recently hit by a brain-shrinking virus, such that we could not expect the average citizen
to be as self-aware as the average (unaffected) immigrant.

In this situation, with all these differences resolved, would I agree with the analogy? Yes, absolutely! In that world, unauthorized immigrants
would not only be stealing, but would be stealing from people with major mental disabilities. On top of that, the immigrants would be taking
a much greater share than the citizens get, and many citizens would be left without the resources that the immigrants took. I would be the first to say that in this
scenario, better enforcement was needed.

But of course... we don't live in this scenario.

### The Better Analogy

At least there's one point in Mr. Buttazzoni's video that I agree with:

"Although maybe it's a stretch to make this analogy, I do think it's always interesting and always important to see the parallels in our society."(2:20)

Dang straight, Mr. Buttazzoni! With that end in mind, let's make this analogy fit a little better. Let's imagine a video where instead of adults taking candy, it is children (putting them on the same level of moral
development as the intended recipients). Add to this scenario the stipulation that out-of-town children are explicitly allowed to take candy, by the homeowners (just like
some states explicitly allow unauthorized immigrants access to social services). Now let's also say that these out-of-town children take a little less candy from the bowl than others (just like unauthorized immigrants use less in social services than citizens do).
They don't prevent any other trick-or-treaters from getting their candy (just like offering services to these immigrants
doesn't deprive citizens). 

When you adjust the analogy to fit reality, the moral objection goes away. That situtaion is what Aldo Buttazonni is objecting to.
Here's hoping that, with a little reconsideration, he might find his objections are addressed.

The section entitled "Do Immigrants Use Public Benefits More Than Other Groups" addresses the comparison directly,
including a brief discussion of the restrictionist habit of widenning the metric to include the native born
U.S. citizen children of these immigrants.
