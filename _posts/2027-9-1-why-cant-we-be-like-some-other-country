# Why Can't We Be Like Some Other Country?
## For people who lay claim to a fervent patriotism, many restrictionists seem to really admire the immigration policies of other countries. Until they learn about them.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists often say that other nations should serve as an example for what America's immigration policy
should be. Sometimes these comparisons are appropriate and interesting analogues. Other times, they are a horrific 
abandonment of the best of American values.


This pattern of comparison shows up in the challenge that some restrictionist writers give to "name any country that has survived 
open borders". Even if we said, for the sake of argument, that no country in the world has open borders, this wouldn't mean 
that America couldn't possibly have them.

Any one of these comparisons is worth a post on its own, but in the meantime, here's a rapid-fire sampling of country comparisons.

## "Why can't we be like Canada?"

Canada stands out as the most commonly cited role model from restrictionists, and I would heartily agree with them that Canada makes a great
analogue to the U.S. Like the U.S., it's a highly developed, North American, English-speaking country. Thanks in part to its geographic closeness, 
Canadian commerce and culture overlap so much with the U.S. that the differenches seem minor. Canada challenges the central idea of certain
national chauvinists that nation-states are based on fundamenally unchangeable and irreconciliable values and worldviews.

    My agreement with the comparison to Canada goes further: restrictionists often recommend that we switch to a points-based system like Canada's,
and I would immediately welcome this change! A points-based system allows for much more flexibility than the U.S.'s cap-based system. Canada allows
immigrants at four times the per-capita rate of the United States, and has a foreign-born population at double it's percentage. On its face, Canada makes a mockery 
of restrictionists claims that the U.S. is on the verge of cultural collapse. If I could convince restrictionists to support a points-based 
Canadian-style immigration system


## "Why can't we be like Australia?"

Canada and Australia are good analogues to America in many ways. They're both geographically large, highly developed English-speaking
countries. They also both use a "points system" of immigration (where immigrant candidates are granted 'points' from traits
like family connections and marketable skills.)

## "Why can't we be like Israel?"

"I admire Israel's policy and we could adopt it. Show me in a straight line why we can't do what they do. If Israel's ethnicity changes,
the idea of Israel changes. If America's ethnicity changes, the idea of our country changes too."[^coulter-on-israel]

"Countries such as Israel have demonstrated that only a physical barrier restrains human movement across a border."[^gilchrist-on-israel]

Israel makes an odd choice for a restrictionist role model. The country's Law of Return means that, in per-capita terms,
Israel's immigration rate for the past 80 years has wildly outpaced that of the U.S., and from a wide variety of 
countries. From that lens, restrictionists and I might find some common ground: the U.S. should allow much more immigration
per capita, just as Israel does. Treating Israel as a role model for border security raises its own obvious problems.

Ms. Coulter's specific appeal to ethnicity is particularly worrying. If the U.S. is meant to be home to a particular ethnicity (like
Israel), what ethnicity specifically is Ms. Coulter thinking of? Hmmmm...

## 'Why can't we be like Japan?'

"Why don't we select immigrants based on talent... Other countries do. In countries like Canada, Australia, and Japan, more than half of all immigrants are accepted based on skills and employment."[^homan-on-japan]

"The bottom line is this: the days are over when in-migration could be defended as a solution to any national problem. Japan has known this all along."[^garrett-on-japan]


## Why can't we be like Slovakia?

"Slovakia continued to refuse to have any part in what its government described as a 'nonsense' and 'complete fiasco'. The left-wing Slovakian Prime Minister, Robort Fico, said in despair 'I feel
that we in the EU are now committing ritual suicide and we're just looking on'. The difference from their Western Eropean partners 
could not have been more stark. What was it that made the East and West of the same continent think so differently on such central issues?"[^murray-on-slovakia]

Slovakia makes another odd roll model. 

In this section of his book, Murray is specifically comparing Slovakia to Sweden, but even after decades of a supposedly fundamental difference in policies,

Today, Slovakia doesn't seem to have 'preserved its culture' any more than Sweden has. [Research these differences].
