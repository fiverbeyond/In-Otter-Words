# Why Can't We Be Like Some Other Country?
## For people who lay claim to a fervent patriotism, many restrictionists seem to really admire the immigration policies of other countries. Until they learn about them.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists often say that other nations should serve as an example for what America's immigration policy
should be. Sometimes these comparisons are appropriate and interesting analogues. Other times, they are a horrific 
abandonment of the best of American values.


This pattern of comparison shows up in the challenge that some restrictionist writers give to "name any country that has survived 
open borders". Even if we said, for the sake of argument, that no country in the world has open borders, this wouldn't mean 
that America couldn't possibly have them.

Any one of these comparisons is worth a post on its own, but in the meantime, here's a rapid-fire sampling of country comparisons.

## "Why can't we be like Canada?"

Canada stands out as the most commonly cited role model from restrictionists, and I would heartily agree with them that Canada makes a great
analogue to the U.S. Like the U.S., it's a highly developed, North American, English-speaking country. Thanks in part to its geographic closeness, 
Canadian commerce and culture overlap so much with the U.S. that the differenches seem minor. Canada challenges the central idea of certain
national chauvinists that nation-states are based on fundamenally unchangeable and irreconciliable values and worldviews.

    My agreement with the comparison to Canada goes further: restrictionists often recommend that we switch to a points-based system like Canada's,
and I would immediately welcome this change! A points-based system allows for much more flexibility than the U.S.'s cap-based system. Canada allows
immigrants at four times the per-capita rate of the United States, and has a foreign-born population at double it's percentage. On its face, Canada makes a mockery 
of restrictionists claims that the U.S. is on the verge of cultural collapse. If I could convince restrictionists to support a points-based 
Canadian-style immigration system


## "Why can't we be like Australia?"

Canada and Australia are good analogues to America in many ways. They're both geographically large, highly developed English-speaking
countries. They also both use a "points system" of immigration (where immigrant candidates are granted 'points' from traits
like family connections and marketable skills.)

## "Why can't we be like Israel?"

"I admire Israel's policy and we could adopt it. Show me in a straight line why we can't do what they do. If Israel's ethnicity changes,
the idea of Israel changes. If America's ethnicity changes, the idea of our country changes too."[^coulter-on-israel]

"Countries such as Israel have demonstrated that only a physical barrier restrains human movement across a border."[^gilchrist-on-israel]

Israel makes an odd choice for a restrictionist role model. The country's Law of Return means that, in per-capita terms,
Israel's immigration rate for the past 80 years has wildly outpaced that of the U.S., and from a wide variety of 
countries. From that lens, restrictionists and I might find some common ground: the U.S. should allow much more immigration
per capita, just as Israel does. Treating Israel as a role model for border security raises its own obvious problems.

Ms. Coulter's specific appeal to ethnicity is particularly worrying. If the U.S. is meant to be home to a particular ethnicity (like
Israel), what ethnicity specifically is Ms. Coulter thinking of? Hmmmm...

## 'Why can't we be like Japan?'

"Why don't we select immigrants based on talent... Other countries do. In countries like Canada, Australia, and Japan, more than half of all immigrants are accepted based on skills and employment."[^homan-on-japan]

"The bottom line is this: the days are over when in-migration could be defended as a solution to any national problem. Japan has known this all along."[^garrett-on-japan]


## Why can't we be like Slovakia?

"Slovakia continued to refuse to have any part in what its government described as a 'nonsense' and 'complete fiasco'. The left-wing Slovakian Prime Minister, Robort Fico, said in despair 'I feel
that we in the EU are now committing ritual suicide and we're just looking on'. The difference from their Western Eropean partners 
could not have been more stark. What was it that made the East and West of the same continent think so differently on such central issues?"[^murray-on-slovakia]

Slovakia makes another odd role model. 

In this section of his book, Murray is specifically comparing Slovakia to Sweden, but even after decades of a supposedly fundamental difference in policies,
Today, Slovakia doesn't seem to have 'preserved its culture' any more than Sweden has. Sweden has triple the GDP per capita, 


## 'Why can't we be like Afghanistan?'

"If we can protect the porous border of Afghanistan, with 177 checkpoints and 12,000 border police, surely we can protect the border of the United States of America."[^dougherty-afghanistan]

Doughterty's comparison was made in 2004, only a few years after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. With hindsight, it's deceptively straightforward to counter the comparison:
the United States *didn't* protect the porous border of Afghanistan, not even with 12,000 border police. No raw number of troops was sufficient to maintain control
over the country, or to keep it safe from outside terrorist activity. 

Now, to be fair, the U.S. Mexico border is 'easier' in some ways. For one, it's smaller (only about 2000 miles to Afghanistan's 3500-mile circumference).
There are also more than 12,000 border patrol agents. But one glaring difference between the two borders is the amount of commerce that goes between them.
Several hundred million vehicles cross the U.S.-Mexico border every year, carrying cargo, tourists, businessmen, and temporary workers. The traffic over the border of
Afghanistan could not possibly come close to the same amount. The two borders are simply incomparable in terms of the effort it would take to make them
secure.


## 'Why can't we be like Mexico?'

"Mexico's law regarding illegal immigrants is simple: If outsiders do not enhance the country's economic or national interests or are not found to be physically or 
mentally healthy, they are not welcome... Law enforcement officials at all levels -- by national mandate -- must cooperate to enforce immigratrion laws,
including illegal alien arrests and deportations. The Mexican military is also required to assist in immigration enforcement operations."[^ankarlo-on-mexico]

Dan Ankarlo's approval of Mexico's immigration system is a real head-scratcher. On the one hand, he is evidently envious of Mexico's harsh measures
against unauthorized immigrants... but on the other hand, he describes Mexico's treatment of these immigrants as "Not so great", and opens his section
with a Fox News quote pointing out that Mexico has been cited by human rights groups for their harsh treatment of immigrants and refugees. Suggesting
that the United States follow Mexico's lead is even more confusing when one asks if Mexico really is an example of restrictionism's effectivity:
if Mexico is truly a good model of immigration control, how exactly are so many unauthorized immigrants making their way through the 
country to the U.S. border?

## And my least favorite... 'Why can't we be like China?'

"Today, China is once again battling drug smuggling because, like America, it also has a poor, corrupt nation with a massive humanitarian crisis on its border: 
Not Mexico, but North Korea. Guess what China did? It built a fence!"[^coulter-on-china]

"What can Americans learn from China's population growth?... China's leaders used their Communist Party control over housing,
employment, and salaries to institute three reproductive norms: (1) late marriage, (2) longer spacing between births, and 
(3) fewer children... How successful has China's drive to reduce its population been? The good news is,
China's population is now projected to decline... In a democracy, it is likely to take longer to effectively address a 
population growth problem than in a dictatorship."[^hartman-on-china]

To be fair to Ms. Coulter's approval of Chinese policy, she seems more interested in the efficacy of a border fence
than in recommending China's immigration policies in general. Evenso, her comparison is a poor one: North Korea,
unlike Mexico, is a shut-in country, with almost no private trade, business, tourism, or immigration over 
its border with China at all. This doesn't compare with the U.S.-Mexico border, which has hundreds of millions
of people crossing legally every year. Neither is China's border fence as effective as Ms. Coulter seems to imagine:
illegal immigration and smuggling still occur regularly, both into and out of North Korea.
Finally, and most importantly, this hard border is a moral disaster, forcefully trapping many people in North Korea
who could live much better lives elsewhere. For Ms. Coulter to look fondly at such an icon of isolation reveals a fundamental ethic, 
that it is better for people to remain trapped in a totalitarian dictatorship, than to risk the supposed horrors of cultural
intermingling.

While Hartman's approval of China's population control does not mention immigration, it is a frequent topic in his book, which
is recommended reading from the restrictionist organization F.A.I.R. To offer a modest counter: no, it was not a good thing
that China's communist party had absolute control over reproductive decisions. It was totalitarian, tyrannical, and 
a clear example of government overreach. Hartman's intimation that this was all justified by the danger of overpopulation
was bad science then, and thoroughly disproven now, and all these same arguments go for China's approach to immigration.
