# Why Can't We Be Like Some Other Country?
## For people who lay claim to a fervent patriotism, many restrictionists seem to really admire the immigration policies of other countries. Until they learn about them.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists often say that other nations should serve as an example for what America's immigration policy
should be. Sometimes these comparisons are appropriate and interesting analogues. Other times, they are a horrific 
abandonment of the best of American values.


This pattern of comparison shows up in the challenge that some restrictionist writers give to "name any country that has survived 
open borders". Even if we said, for the sake of argument, that no country in the world has open borders, this wouldn't mean 
that America couldn't possibly have them.

Any one of these comparisons is worth a post on its own, but in the meantime, here's a rapid-fire sampling of country comparisons.

## "Why can't we be like Canada?"
## "Why can't we be like Australia?"

Canada and Australia are good analogues to America in many ways. They're both geographically large, highly developed English-speaking
countries. They also both use a "points system" of immigration (where immigrant candidates are granted 'points' from traits
like family connections and marketable skills.)
