# Five Awful Books Recommended by FAIR
## I'd be ashamed of myself if I let these slide.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** FAIR, a prominent restrictionist organization, keeps a list of reading recommendations.
These are the worst stinkers from that list.


Now that I've taken the pains to read all of FAIR's recommended literature and even recommended some of the books they promote,
I can't bear to move on to a new topic without taking the opportunity to publicly shame FAIR for their taste in books.


## 5 - In Mortal Peril

In Mortal Peril serves as a stand-in for a good dozen or so "bog-standard" restrictionist books. Once you've read a few of these, you see the pattern.
Gather up some news reports of immigrant murderers, throw in some 'terrorist watchlist' references.
"In Mortal Peril" gets to be the representative of this boilerplate, only because its title is so funny.

## 4 - Fighting Immigration Anarchy

## 2 - Alien Nation by Peter Brimelow

Author Peter Brimelow comes off as a perfectly respectable, cultured, and intellectual restrictionist. An immigrant himself, he was a well-respected speaker in the 1990s, making frequent
appearances on TV programs and high-profile debates.

But in "Alien Nation", Brimelow's views are simply detestable. The thesis of "Alien Nation" rests almost entirely on the then-distant prediction that the United States was going to become
a majority-minority nation with respect to race: white people would be in the minority. Mr. Brimelow treats this outcome as a disaster, and the end of America. 
He makes it clear through his arguments that he sees the essence of America's nationhood as deeply, fundamentally, white. 

There's no way around it: this book advocates for white nationalism. It doesn't belong on any respectable list of restrictionist literature,
no matter how well-spoken or well-educated the author was. I'm sure that Mr. Brimelow doesn't see himself as a white nationalist, but that's
because by his own admission, he doesn't know what the term means. Where did he say this? In a chummy one-on-one podcast interview
with Jared Taylor, self described "white advocate" and founder of the white supremacist organization American Renaissance.

But even explicit white nationalism is not the worst on offer on FAIR's recommended list.
Your opinion may differ, but for my part, the worst of the worst goes to...

## 1 - The Immigration Dilemma

I can't express my disappointment at the discovery that the same person was the source of both one of my favorite analogies (The Tragedy of the Commons)
and one of my least favorite (The Lifeboat Analogy).

Dr. Hardin explicitly calls for millions of people to be left to starve. 

It's not just that Dr. Hardin's predictions were utterly wrong.
It's that they were entirely insubstantiated to begin with, and yet he felt that it justified policies that would result in the deaths of millions.

FAIR should be ashamed that this book was ever proposed for their list, let alone that they ended up recommending it.


## Honorable Mention: The Camp of the Saints

For those who are thankfully unaware, The Camp of the Saints is widely understood to be deeply 
racist and xenophobic propaganda. I've described it as "Surprisingly similar to a zombie apocalypse story, except instead of zombies, brown people."
It imagines a future crisis where a million foreigners from Africa commandeer a fleet of ships, intent on landing in Europe.
In what the novel depicts as a natural consequence, the immigrants' arrival on the shores of France immediately results
in complete apocalypse, leaving France literally in ruins. 
With all the diplomacy and nuance I can muster, I still feel safe saying "This book is filth". It 
belongs in the same curio box as "The Turner Diaries" and "Birth of a Nation", to be 

I doubt that even the most ardent restrictionist would defend the book from 
the charge of "bigotted xenophobia", and I would eagerly invite any restrictionist reader to
prove me wrong. Make a public apology of this putrid literary cesspool, defend its depictions and core values,
and aire your thoughts for all to hear. I would be more than pleased to platform your ideas
by writing a response post. This invitation goes double for anybody working at FAIR.

"But wait!", says the observant reader, "That book isn't even *on* FAIR's list of recommended readings."
And indeed, to be fair to FAIR, it is not. Instead, this book is recommended by the books that FAIR recommends.
Three of the books FAIR recommends approvingly cite "The Camp of the Saints", never with any hint of disapproval.
