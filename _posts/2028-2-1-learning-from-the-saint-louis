 # Learning from the Saint Louis
## Why turning away Jewish refugees in 1939 was bad.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In his book *Unguarded Gates*, historian Otis L. Graham gives a mild defense of U.S. immigration policy
just before the second world war. To me, the listed defenses don't hold weight morally.

## Some Important Disclaimers and Admissions

Some of my posts are explicitly dismissive of restrictionist ideas and rhetoric (and I would say this is rightly so). Sometimes
I even mock restrictionism.
This is not what I intend to do in this post, for many reasons.
The first is that Mr. Graham does not truly defend the decision to reject incoming Jewish refugees. His comments on refugees
is, in context, more of an explanation of the reasoning of the time, rather than an actual argument that this decision was right.
This is certainly the tone I take from this introductory sentence:

"The ghastly discoveries of the death camps by advancing Allied armies in 1945 led some in retrospect to suggest that 
the United States should have accepted every boatload of fleeing Europeansn in the late 1930s, or have organized some sort of 
of international sharing, thus preventing the Holocaust. This is a retrospective wish, not a historical option."

A second reason for reticence is that Mr. Graham was a respected and emminently qualified historian. He taught as a professor at the 
University of California, and published extensively on both history and immigration. It would be an embarassing example of the
Dunning-Kruger to even pretend that I knew as much about this topic as Graham did. This is also an appropriate time for me
to remind my readers of my professional qualifications on the topic of immigration (i.e., none).

With these caveats firmly in mind, it still seems important to me to explicitly respond to Graham's comments. If we take
his comments as a mere explanation of the motivations of America at the time, then it's important to say why these motivations
were, in my view, either factually lacking or morally bankrupt. I would appeal directly to Graham's introductory statement that I 
quoted earlier: Yes, "the United States should have accepted every boatload of fleeing Europeans in the late 1930s, or 
have organized some sort of international sharing". The policies at the time were and are morally indefensible. 

## The Context: The Voyage of the MS St. Louis

## Graham's First Defense - The United States had Already Accepted Many Refugees

## Graham's Second Defense - The United States Didn't Know the Holocaust was Coming

"In the 1930s, an immediate open door for millions of Jewish refugees in a decade of massive unemployment,
long before the Holocaust was more than a faint and unbelievable rumor, was not even proposed by American Jewish leadership... 
Whatever Jewish opinion might have been, some sort of mass asylum in America (or anywhere else) was a political 
impossibility..."

Graham is right that at the time of events like the exclusion of the St. Louis, the idea of an upcoming Holocaust
had practically no purchase in the U.S. However, this is not an excuse for excluding refugees, either now or in the past.
[Cite Samantha Powers] Genocides are, as a rule, never explicitly announced in advance. No reasonable understanding of refugee 
programs would include a requirement to only accept refugees after a plan for mass murder had been fully proven beyond reasonable doubt.

By the late 1930s (the time when the St. Louis was turned away), there was already ample persecution of Jewish people to 
justify their admittance as refugees. The Nuremburg laws had been passed, and Jewish people had been barred from military service,
from medical practice, and from intermarriage with Aryans. They'd been stripped of German citizenship, and been forced to register
all their property. Such persecution more than justifies admitting them as refugees. When taken as a sign of impending
incarceration, it demands that admission.


## Graham's Third Defense - Accepting Refugees Encourages More Expulsions

Graham ends his defense with a suggestion that in the end, accepting refugees only creates more problems:

"Such a response would have encouraged Hitler and all other "ethnic cleansing" leaders in the future to expel
undesirable populations as a matter of international routine. It is a hard truth that countries that generously
accept refugees encourage the production of more refugees, creating another problem as they attempt to solve one."

To my ears' first hearing, this defense has the faintest echo of rationality.

But any serious consideration of this idea quickly leads to its rejection. Firstly, let's consider the factuality: is it the case 
that accepting refugees merely leads to more refugees being produced? Perhaps in isolated instances, or at the start of disatrous
conflicts (when the first refugees to a space), but overall, no. We have many examples to look to here.
The United State's acceptance of communist refugees did not merely 
The 'boat people' refugees from the Vietnam War did not trigger a larger 
The Mariel Boat Lift did not result in an even larger migration away from Cuba in [cite the year]. 

The most obvious example of all is the very one Graham discusses: accepting Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. 
The United States eventually accepted more Jewish refugees than any other country, and yet this did not lead to 
further expulsions by the Nazi empire. By Graham's defense, we would need to look at these tens of thousands of 
refugees and say that *the United States should never have accepted them* (since, according to Graham, accepting
these refugees only caused 'another problem').

But this latter defense fails for an even more important reason. Even if it were true that accepting refugees only encourages
dictators to expel more people, *this would be a much better outcome than the alternative*. Graham's defense (which
is an argument not just against immigration, but emigration) suggests that
if victim populations were only forced to remain in the power of their ethnically chauvinist persecutosr, 
on the whole life would be better for these victims. To understate the matter dramatically, it seems much more likely that the
situation would get worse. When Saddam Hussein decided to 'ethnically cleanse' the Kurdish minority, the fact that they could not escape did not soften his 
methods. When [cite Sbrenevic] [or Kosovo]. In the case of Jewish refugees from Germany, the alternative to their escape
was not that the Nazi regime would be forced to reconcile with their ethnic target. The alternative was death. 

## Conclusion

Accepting refugees is not a matter of generousity. It's a matter of safety. Restrictionist writers often call for
stricter policies,
