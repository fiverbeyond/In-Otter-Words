## Why turning away Jewish refugees in 1939 was bad.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In his book *Unguarded Gates*, historian Otis L. Graham gives a mild defense of U.S. immigration policy
just before the second world war. To me, the listed defenses don't hold weight morally.

## Some Important Disclaimers and Admissions

Some of my posts are explicitly dismissive of restrictionist ideas and rhetoric (and I would say this is rightly so). Sometimes
I even mock restrictionism.
This is not what I intend to do in this post, for many reasons.
The first is that Mr. Graham does not truly defend the decision to reject incoming Jewish refugees. His comments on refugees
is, in context, more of an explanation of the reasoning of the time, rather than an actual argument that this decision was right.
This is certainly the tone I take from this introductory sentence:

"The ghastly discoveries of the death camps by advancing Allied armies in 1945 led some in retrospect to suggest that 
the United States should have accepted every boatload of fleeing Europeansn in the late 1930s, or have organized some sort of 
of international sharing, thus preventing the Holocaust. This is a retrospective wish, not a historical option."

A second reason for reticence is that Mr. Graham was a respected and emminently qualified historian. He taught as a professor at the 
University of California, and published extensively on both history and immigration. It would be an embarassing example of the
Dunning-Kruger to even pretend that I knew as much about this topic as Graham did. This is also an appropriate time for me
to remind my readers of my professional qualifications on the topic of immigration (i.e., none).

With these caveats firmly in mind, it still seems important to me to explicitly respond to Graham's comments. If we take
his comments as a mere explanation of the motivations of America at the time, then it's important to say why these motivations
were, in my view, either factually lacking or morally bankrupt. I would appeal directly to Graham's introductory statement that I 
quoted earlier: Yes, the United States should have accepted every boatload of fleeing Europeans in the late 1930s, or 
have organized som sort of international sharing. 

## The Context: The Voyage of the MS St. Louis

## Graham's First Defense - The United States had Already Accepted Many Refugees

## Graham's Second Defense - The United States Didn't Know the Holocaust was Coming




## Graham's Third Defense - Accepting Refugees Encourages More Expulsions
