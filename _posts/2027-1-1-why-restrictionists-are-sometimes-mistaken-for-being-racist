# Why Restrictionists are Sometimes Mistaken for Racists: A Case Study
## Tips for People who Argue for Immigration Restrictions

>**_The Short Stuff:_** Restrictionists universally complain about being unfairly smeared with labels like 'racist'. I give
an example of why this mistake sometimes happens.

The fascinating and subtle relationship between restrictionism and racism is a topic worthy of a 
multi-volume book series. It's a little bit history, and a little bit rhetoric, and a little bit political demography.
In their media, restrictionists make it clear that they do not want to be associated with racism, and that they object to 
the label. Here are a few examples:

[^1] Hardin, Garrett. The Immigration Dilemma. Federation for American Immigration Reform, 1995.pg. 33

[^2] Brimelow, Peter. Alien Nation. Random House, 1995 1st Edition pg. 97

[^3] Tom Tancredo 'Race doesn't matter' interview.

[^4] Sheehy, Daniel. Fighting Immigration Anarchy: American Patriots Battle to Save the Nation. Authorhouse. 2005. Pg. 11

In light of how often restrictionists feel the need to defend themselves here, I'd like to start this post by offering an olive branch --

Restrictionists, I don't think you are racists, at least not the vast majority of you. I certainly don't think restrictionism as a whole
is fundamentally racist. I agree with you that you have often been unfairly accused of being racist, and sometimes I'm sure this
accusation is even just meant to distract from your real arguments. I also understand that this kind of name-calling can sometimes be hurtful.
You don't see yourselves as racists, and (as some of you have pointed out), many of you are even representatives
of minority race groups in the U.S. So I can understand why you might be confused or insulted at being associated with racism.

I have several times read restrictionists express bewilderment
at why anybody would think your political position had any connection to racism. With that in mind, this blog post is meant 
to respond to this confusion, and give you an example so you can understand why, at least in some situtaions,
it might be easy to mistakenly connect restrictionism to racism. I'm not trying to excuse the childish behaviour 
of people who thoughtlessly throw slurs at you. I want to give an example of why sometimes this mix-up can be an honest mistake.

My example comes in the form of a guided tour, of sorts. Come with me, as we re-enact my personal experience...

## Reading "The Path to National Suicide"

"The Path to National Suicide" is a 1990 restrictionist pamphlet, written by Lawrence Auster, and published by the American Immigration Control
Foundation. It is referenced by several other restrictionist books, and Lawrence Auster himself has been described as "the unsung godfather of the restrictionist movement."
The point is that this book isn't a crazed screed by some unknown hack, but a respected and accepted addition to restrictionist literature.
As if to drive the point home, the book begins with the very same anti-racist declarations that other restrictionist books so often include.

"This curious inhibition [to debate immigration] stems, of course, from a paralyzing fear of the charge of "racism."  The very manner in which 
the issue is framed -- as a matter of equal rights and the blessings of diversity on one side, versus "racism" on the other -- tends to cut off
all rational discourse on the subject." (pg. 8)

So Mr. Auster shares the pains of modern restrictionists in being baselessly accused of racism. He even seems annoyed that the constant
charge of 'racism' should distract from the 'real' issues that restrictionists want to discuss.

Very well, then. An open-minded reader should not start with any assumption of a racial focus. They should feel comfortable reading through 
a pamphlet that, on its face, finally deals with the topic of immigration, independent from race.

### Lawrence Auster, Anti-Racist?

Mr. Auster even includes clear anti-racist sentiments when he describes the history of immigcration restrictions. He says "The new immigrants, so different
in appearance and habits from the earlier Americans, had aroused profound fears never officially sanctioned, in the form of a racial ideology
that viewed the Nordic, or northern European, groups as superior to other Caucasian peoples." (pg. 11)

Again, we can feel comforted that Mr. Auster recognizes (and openly calls out) the racism that motivated the restrictionism of the 1920s.
That ending phrase of "other Caucasian peoples" might seem a little old fashioned (why not "other races"?) but it doesn't detract from what
is clearly a censure of racially-motivated restrictionism. A student of restrictionism reading the pamphlet at this point might feel comfortably certain that
Mr. Auster's restrictionism is not race-based.

And yet... for an anti-racist, whose restrictionism is not based in race, Mr. Auster might need to work on some phrasing.

### Some Awkward Phrasing

For example, after expressing fears of America being subsumed by "Hispanic and Carribbean and Asian peoples", he says he wants 
"an honest debate between those who favor a radical change in America's ethnic and cultural identity, and those who think
this nation should preserve it's way of life, and its predominant European-American character."

'European-American'? This phrase should straightforwardly include Hispanic and Carribbean people, whose polity, culture, and ethnicity
directly stem from a mix of European and American traditions. If these groups are "European-American", why would their inclusion pose a threat
to America's "European-American character"? This would be easily explainable if Mr. Auster means to use "European-American" as a shorthand for
racial characteristics... but he's already made it clear that his restrictionism is divorced from racial ideas. Maybe this was just awkward phrasing.

Then, later in the pamphlet, Auster bemoans the fact

"Erwin contended that the [1965] bill did not eliminate national and racial discrimination from our immigration law, but only instituted a new
form of discrimination against our traditional immigrant groups... In effect, we were replacing a sensible -- though admittedly too restrictive -- 
type of discrimination favoring our historic source nations and skilled persons, by a senseless type of discrimination favoring extended
families from Third-World countries."

Then there are other odd phrases that pop out. Auster complains that the United States's identity with the words "our historic character 
as a predominanly Caucasian, Western society,". What, precisely, is 'Caucasian' society, to an anti-racist?

Another odd phrasing pops up when Mr. Auster describes his complaints against the 1965 Immigration Reform act. Keeping in mind that, for Mr. Auster, immigration 
restriction is not at all about racial purity, what should we make of descriptions like this?

"Clearly, there was an expectation that new immigrants would only augment the cosmopolitan mix of minorities in our predominantly white society. 
Clearly, there was a consensus that the United States had the intention, as well as the right, to preserve its "cultural pattern." Yet today, both liberals and conservatives
speak the language of cultural diversity, and they seem to look forward with complacency, even eagerness, to the prospect of the U.S.
becoming a white-minority country during the coming century." (pg. 28).

Now, since Mr. Auster's interest in immigration is not motivated by racial segregation, what are we to make of this statement?
What does "cultural pattern" have to do with maintaining a white racial majority? It really sounds as if, for Mr. Auster, 
cultural heritage is synonymous with racial makeup, and American identity is centered on a population being majority white.

But maybe we're misjudging here? This could simply be a case of Mr. Auster reporting on the race-focused sensibilities of 
the 1965s, rather than agreeing with them. Still, for an argument that has nothing to do with race, it's a little odd
that these phrases keep popping up.

The young restrictionist reading this pamphlet might at least wish that the author had taken more care to keep racial phrases out of the text.
After all... the argument for restrictionism is not based in race, or even remotely connected. There's no reason to bring the topic up at all.

But then, the student will turn the page, and come to...

## "Chapter Three: On the Meaning of Racism"

By now, apparently against its own wishes, this book is simply about race. Mr. Auster pauses his (supposedly unrelated) defense of restrictionism
and instead changes topics about how the word 'racist' is used in modern society.

"As we all know by now, racism, like witchcraft, is a difficult accusation to defend oneself against. The reason is that the word no longer has 
a defined meaning.... "Racism" now apparently means anything that, in the view of black people, hurt their interests or offended them or, indeed, 
anything they did not approve of."

Now, there are undoubtedly many restrictionist readers who agree with Mr. Auster's understanding of race and racism... but this still
doesn't explain why it is so vital to expound on the topic in a book about restrictionism (which, again, has nothing to do with race, say restrictionists).
But never mind; let's indulge Mr. Auster's diversion as we go deeper into the chapter. Mr. Auster makes a few
eyebrow-raising claims.

"But since America is [supposedly] inherently racist, it can never succeed in [becoming good]. It follows that America can only become a good 
country when it ceases to exist, i.e., when its European-rooted civilization is dismantled."

A very odd fear to describe, if "European-rooted civilization" has no connection to race. Could not a multi-racial society participate in "European-rooted civilization",
even if it was not majority white?

Truly, an apocalyptic vision! But... is this how we view other inherent vices? If America understands that politicians will always have a temptation
toward tyranny, does it follow that the entire American civilization must be dismantled? 

Auster cites (and then rejects) the definition of racism found in Webster's dictionary, and insists on a much higher bar for what should qualify as 
racism.

"As an attitude, we may say that that racism is contempt for members of a particular racial group becauseo of their alleged inferiority
or badness in relation to one's own group, or that racism consists of the inability to see any member of the other group as a fellow human being." (pg. 66)

This is an unworkable definition of racism. By this definition, slave-holders and slavers were largely not racist, since they clearly had the ability
to see at least *some* members of "the other group" as human beings. Ethno-nationalists who targetted a racial group for expulsion, persecution,
and even death, could discharge themselves of the accusation of racism (as an attitude) by simply admitting the humanity of those they
persecuted. Mr. Auster seems like an author completely unaware of how these groups spoke and acted, as if history were not jam-packed
with tyrants saying the phrase "We're all equal before God, but..." or 'benevolently' selecting special exceptions to their racial categories.
Since these regimes were clearly and proudly capable of seeing at least one member of the victim group as a human being, 
they avoid Mr. Auster's definition of racism.

And wasn't this book supposed to be about immigration?

Mr. Auster tightens his definition further...

"I would say further that the racist belief in another group's inferiority concerns their inherent worth as human beings,
not a mere difference in some particular trait or talent." (pg. 66)

### Auster Goes to the Movies

Like other restrictionist, Auster is particularly worried about the perversion of American culture, those aspects of art, literature, and theater that
are unique to our fresh young nation. So it might come as a suprise to our restrictionist student when as examples, Auster does not even
mention any American artist, author, or playwright, but instead talks about Greek sculpture, and Renaissance paintings (pg 56).
For Auster then, cultural elements from thousands of years in the past and an ocean away are immediately welcomed into the fold
of "American culture"... but even the faintest hint of art or culture from South or Central America, crafted much 
closer in time and place to the nation Auster loves, are absolutely barred from qualifying, under any circumstances.

Fearful of the future that immigration might bring, Auster envisions how America's love of natural family
relationships must be cast aside to make way for... 'Hispanic issues'. For Auster, the love of family members for
each other, if it is depicted in art, must needs to depicted as white.

"As the image of our civilization, as expressed in the arts and literature, changes to a multiracial, multicultural image,
what kind of art will result? Movies and plays, instead of portraying the relationships of individuals within a community or family, 
as drama has done time out of mind, must focus self-consciously on race relations. Established literary works that have
formed a living bridge between one generation of Americans and the next will fall into oblivion, to be replaced by works
on minority Hispanic and Asian issues." (pg. 57)

Yet again... an odd complaint for someone whose cultural concerns are not at all threatened by racial integration.

But for Auster, the disaster extends even to religious worship. We must give up imagination itself,
says Auster, if racial integration becomes reflected in religious art. You can either have
imaginative white characters, or characters from other races that are (apparently) devoid of originality 
and creativity:

"The religious paintings of the multiculturalist society, instead of portraying a group of individuals chosen
from the artists' imagination, would follow a statistical formula; the figures gathered around the Christ
child would have to be x percent brown, x percent black, yellow, white, and so on, all chosen on a basis of racial balance." (pg. 57)


The unpracticed reader of restrictionism might be honestly confused at why this extended discussion of race in art
should be so central a part of a book on immigration. But never fear... Auster will surely tie it all together in his wrap-up section...

### "Immigration and the Meaning of Racism". 

Finally, let's hear how these two topics are connected!

Auster first takes pains to emphasize that racism is, after all, natural:

"The differences among racial and ethnic groups... is connected with another common-sense observation about 
human nature: the preference that human beings have for people who are similar to themselves."

"The very idea of racism implies a human norm that is not racist, and from which racism, by definition, would be a departure. But 
in what does this norm consist? Where in the world are there families and communities that are *not* based on this
mutual preference for people who are similar?... Racism is understood in such a broad, unreal sense that its theoretical opposite -- a "non-racist" human nature -- *must also be unreal.*" (pg. 70)

Auster then fears that, in a senseless attempt to do away with humanity's natural preference for one's own race, a world gone
mad will force a worldwide blending of the races.

"Since racial differences are the very source of racial preferences, the only way the nations of the earth could truly cease being racist
would be to institute a world-wide exchange of populations, creating an identical racial mix in every country, followed by scientifically planned and 
state-controlled intermarriages, resuling in a single perfectly blended human race."

** What Does All This Have To Do With Immigration? **

By this point, the poor good-faith restrictionist must be completely flummoxed. If Auster does not see immigration as a racial issue, why
does this book have a such a focus on race? If Auster does not mean for immigration restrictions to be aimed 
at protecting any racial segregation, why the long discussion of how natural it is for people to prefer the members of their own race?

Even the section explicitly devoted to immigration ("Immigration and the Meaning of Racism") spends most of its time discussing
how natural racism is, and how horrifying a racially mixed world would be. Why... if this has no connection to the topic of the pamphlet?
Even if our restrictionist reader still believes Auster's argument to be race-agnostic, wouldn't someone so wary of accusations
of racism avoid these obvious .
Why would he quote, of all people, Strom Thurmand (pg. 74), a man most notably known for his defense of racial segregation?
Wasn't there at least a copy-editor who could tap Mr. Auster on the shoulder and, in a gently understanding tone, point out
that this might not be a good look?

Auster then makes it clear that, for him, America has a right to 'maintain its character' (a phrase
that I'm sure many restrictionists would heartily agree with). He explicitly that this 'character' must include race. 
Just as America (in Auster's eyes) must never change with respect to religion, or politics, or language, 
so it must remain the same racially.

"It is asserted by all opponents of white imperialismm that societies have the right to maintain their cultural identities. In the interests
of fairness, I would say that the United States of America also has this right. Now, in trying to ascertain the cultural identity of
any community, we would not ignore its ethnic and racial character any more than we would ignore its political traditions, its way of life, its language,
its religion." 


### Auster's Restrictionism, as it Pertains to Race

There's no two ways about it: Mr. Auster's restrictionism is a restrictionism of racial segregation. 
His goal in limiting immigration is ensure that the majority of Americans in the future are white.
He sees a multi-racial society as a horrorific apocalypse, to be avoided at all costs, and he explicitly uses
immigration restrictionism to achieve his goals.

Now with all that said, a restrictionist reader might defend Auster by saying that he's still "not racist". 
Maybe Auster is just "racially motivated".
Perhaps it would be best ot describe Auster's view as "race-conscious restrictionism" or "racially motivated immigration control".

To all these rhetorical defenses, right now I will bend over backwards and grant

But restrictionists... can you at least see howw, to the untrained eye, Mr. Auster might *appear* racist?
How his particular brand of restrictionism might be *mistaken* for racism? Can you see how, if the primary goal of 
immigration control were *racial* control, this might come off as at least a little bit racist?
