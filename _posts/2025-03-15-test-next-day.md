>**_Summary:_** Aldo Buttazonni tells people that California spends much more on unauthorized immigrants than on veterans, but he does this by counting up different kinds of spending. For the veterans, he only counts
special expenditures by the Office of Veterans Affairs. For the immigrants, he includes all state spending on goods and services (which he excludes for his veteran's number).
