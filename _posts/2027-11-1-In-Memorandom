[^Lamm]: "Can a country's national identity really be endangered by immigration? Let me give on example: Barbados... tens of thousands of newcomers are eroding the distinctivenress
of Barbadian culture, overwhelming the native culture of their homeland." Lamm, Richard D, and Gary Imhoff. The Immigration Time Bomb. Dutton Adult, 1985, pg 81.

[^Lamm_2]: Ibid, pg. 81

[^Lamm_3]: "The Cuban migration to Miami has created within the United States a major city that many Americans experience as culturally and socially foreign.
Ibid, pg. 90
"Miami, as well as large parts of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington and other major American cities, is an example
of how unassimilated large-scale migration can alter the face of America."
Ibid, pg. 93

[^Turek]: "Mass immigration has ruined Beirut and ruined Lebanon." Cross Examined. “The Shocking History of Open Borders with Historian Bill Federer.” YouTube, 3 Oct. 2024, www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFOnQ8jGx30. Accessed 22 Sept. 2025. (58:32)

[^la-worst-schools]: "The Los Angeles area is crumbling under the immigration-driven population explosion and importation of massive poverty... illegal alien gangsters terrorize neighborhoods and commit
virtually all of the murders in the region...Schools have gone from best to worst in the nation."
Sheehy, Daniel. Fighting Immigration Anarchy: American Patriots Battle to Save the Nation. Authorhouse. 2005. Pg. 12

[^anarchy]: "California has one last chance to save itself. It must replace Gray Davis with a governor who will send Proposition 187 back to the courts and send the National Guard to the border...soon after,
Americans will end their exile in the deserts and retern to the shores of the Golden State. Short of this, California will sink into the abyss."
Ibid, Pg. 85

[^nebraska]: "In Scheyler, Nebraska, Americans are in shock because illegal aliens, mostly from Mexico, have invaded their town... 
Small Widwestrern towns such as Schuyler, where Americans once made good livings before being forced out of work, are eevolving into Mexican villages."
Ibid, Pg. 22

[^jack-weir]: "The population has 
exploded, but highway capacity has not increased. Roads and bridges are in terrible repair. Our kids can't read, spell, make change from a purchase, or name our state's capital. Our energy infrastructure
is in collapse. People's lives and livelihoods are in jeopardy." Hartman, Edward C. The Population Fix: Breaking America’s Addiction to Population Growth. Think Population Press. 4 July, 2006, pg. p35

[^hartman-on-china]: "China's population was approximately 600 million in 1970, when the Chinese government decided *something had to be done* about its rapidly growing population... What lessons can America learn from 
China and India?... Eventually, population growth becomes so disastrous that a nation's leaders, whether autocratic or democratic, must acknowledge the problem and make some gesture toward addressing it."
Hartman, Edward C. The Population Fix: Breaking America’s Addiction to Population Growth. Think Population Press. 4 July, 2006, pg. p58

[^india-disaster]: "What can America learn from China and India?  First, America will eventually break itrs addiction to rampant population growth... it is simply a matter of time.
Eventually, population growth becomes so disastrous that a nation's leaders... must acknowledge the problem and make some gesture toward addressing it."
Ibid, pg. 58

[^river-of-blood]: Powell, Enoch. Rivers of Blood. Conservative Association Meeting. April 20 1968.

[^tancredo-on-houston]: "Houston, like much of the Southwest, had been slowly transformed from a uniquely American city into a multicultural wastelland where U.S. residents were giving way to a rush of illegal aliens.
Worse, no one... seemed to care that one of the nation's largest cities was being diluted into an ethnically unrecognizable multicultural-opolis." 
Tancredo, Tom. In Mortal Danger: The Battle for America’s Border and Security. Cumberland House Publishing, 2006, pg. 106

[^turek-on-lebanon]: "Mass immigration has ruined Beirut and ruined Lebanon." Cross Examined. “The Shocking History of Open Borders with Historian Bill Federer.” YouTube, 3 Oct. 2024, www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFOnQ8jGx30. Accessed 22 Sept. 2025. (58:32)

[^buchanan-on-los-angeles]: "If one wishes to see America's future, he need only drive through
L.A. Sifting through the census data from Year 2000, three writers at the *Los Angeles Times* discovered the coming America in the sprawling
county that has become a polyglot nation where extremes of wealth and poverty mirror those of the third world. 
Though America had just ended two of the most prosperous decades in her history, Los Angeles had become a separate nation. During the 1990s, poverty in Los Angeles County did not remain stable 
or decline, but shot up 28 percent."
Buchanan, Pat. State of Emergency. Thomas Dunne Books, 2006, pg. 46

[^cragged-hill]: "If there are any grounds for my belief that the country is already overpopulated—overpopulated, above all, from the environmental standpoint—then 
that would in itself suggest that we should take a new look at the whole problem of immigration."
George Frost Kennan. Around the Cragged Hill. W. W. Norton & Company, 1994., pg. 141

[‌^vance]: “In Springfield, and communities across this country, you have schools that are overwhelmed, housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes...
...The people I’m worried about in Springfield are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’ open border.”
Vance, J.D. Vice Presidential Debate., Oct. 1st, 2024, New York
