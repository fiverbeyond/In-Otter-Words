[^anarchy]: "California has one last chance to save itself. It must replace Gray Davis with a governor who will send Proposition 187 back to the courts and send the National Guard to the border...soon after,
Americans will end their exile in the deserts and retern to the shores of the Golden State. Short of this, California will sink into the abyss."
