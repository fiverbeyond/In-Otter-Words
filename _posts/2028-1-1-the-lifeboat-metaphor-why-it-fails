# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #3 : Why the Lifeboat Analogy Fails
## Allowing more immigration is not like letting a lifeboat get swamped.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In a previous blog post, I introduced the Lifeboat Analogy and gave some examples to suggest it's 
a poor analogy. In this post, I give it a straight disection and explain where the analogy fails.

For those of you just joining in, this is the second part of an analysis of the Lifeboat Analogy, Garret Hardin's popular metaphor
for immigration that suggests the United States is like a lifeboat on the verge of swamping, and that its inhabitants
would be justified in rejecting any immigration, even by violent means. The justification lies in the claim
that, if too many 'survivors' climb onto the lifeboat, the boat will swamp and capsize, dooming everyone in it to the
same, terrible fate.

So let's clarify why this is bunk.

## How I Like to Dissolve an Analogy



1) Clarify the parts of the analogy.
2) Point out the relevant differences between the analogy and reality.
3) Prove their relevance by saying that if these distinctions were resolved, you would agree with the analogy.

## Step One: Clarifying the Lifeboat Analogy

## Step Two: Identifying the Relevant Differences

### The Lifeboat has a Capsize


## Step THree: Prove the Relevance
