# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #3 : Why the Lifeboat Analogy Fails
## Allowing more immigration is not like letting a lifeboat get swamped.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In a previous blog post, I introduced the Lifeboat Analogy and gave some examples to suggest it's 
a poor analogy. In this post, I give it a straight disection and explain where the analogy fails.

For those of you just joining in, this is the second part of an analysis of the Lifeboat Analogy, Garret Hardin's popular metaphor
for immigration that suggests the United States is like a lifeboat on the verge of capsizing, and that its inhabitants
would be justified in rejecting any immigration, even by violent means. The justification lies in the claim
that, if too many 'survivors' climb onto the lifeboat, the boat will swamp and capsize, dooming everyone in it to the
same, terrible fate.

So let's clarify why this is bunk.

## How I Like to Dissolve an Analogy

Some of you may remember my [cite] preferred method for dissolving an analogy. To refresh, the basic steps are:

1) Clarify the parts of the analogy.
2) Point out the relevant differences between the analogy and reality.
3) Prove the relevance of the differences by saying that if these distinctions were resolved, I would agree with the analogy.

## Step One: Clarifying the Lifeboat Analogy

"Metaphorically, each rich nation amounts to a lifeboat full of comparitively rich people. The poor are in other, much more 
crowded lifeboats. Continuously, so to speak, the poor fall out of their lifeboats and swim for a while in the water outside,
hoping to be admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in some other way to benefit from the 'goodies' on board." (Hardin, pg. 36)

Let us set aside, for the moment, Hardin's original description of poor people actually having lifeboats of their own,
and confine ourselves to those people who, as Hardin says, 'fall out of their lifeboats'. The metaphor Hardin is making 
seems straightforward:

|-------------|----------------|
| **Target**      |   **Source**       |
| Rich people     |   Passengers in a 'rich' lifeboat  |
| Poor people     |   Swimmers in the water |
| Lifeboat supplies       | 'Goodies' (i.e., the opportunity to continue living) | 


I think the Lifeboat Metaphor relies heavily on some implied assumptions, one exposed by Hardin, the other not addressed.
They both relate to the 'capsize mechanic', the natural sequence of events that leads to a lifeboat swamping due to
holding more passengers than its carrying capacity.

## 1) The capsize mechanic ends in everyone involved being reduced to that of swimming survivors.

This assumption is at the heart of the metaphor's appeal to Utilitarianism (which is surprising in and of itself, considering that Hardin explicitly rejects
utilitarianism). The disaster proposed by the lifeboat metaphor isn't just that some in-boat survivors may be endangered: it's that absolutely
everyone involved in the situation will be reduced to a similar state of ruin. The in-water survivors will have gained nothing (they're still 
swimming in the ocean) and the in-boat survivors will all be swimming in the ocean as well. Hardin makes this clear in his presentation of the 
metaphor:

"We may be tempted to try to live by the Christian ideal of being "our brother's keeper", or by the Marxian ideal
of "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". Since the needs of all are the same,
we take all the needy into our boat, making a total of 150 in aboat with a capacity of 60t. The boat is swamped, and everyone drowns. 
Complete justice, complete catastrophe."

  The utilitarian calculation here is straightforward: repelling the incoming swimmers will result in the 60 passengers being saved... 
but allowing swimmers to approach the lifeboat will end in the worst possible outcome. 

## 2) The capsize mechanic is irreversible and unremediable.

    When a lifeboat swamps, once the water starts rushing over the rim of the boat, there's nothing anybody can do to stop it.
This is important to the analogy, because Mr. Hardin is trying to say that the 'tipping point' for the entire nation is
similar; a sudden, irreversible process that will trigger as soon as the total population of a country reaches
a particular number. 


## Step Two: Identifying the Relevant Differences

## 1. A lifeboat has a defined carrying capacity.  A nation does not.

The bouyancy forces that stop a lifeboat's rim from dipping underwater are a matter of high school physics. Given a description of the boat's mass and volume, you can 
calculate how much weight it can carry before the rim no longer keeps the water out.

Nations (and states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, etc) don't work like that, despite what "overpopulationists" may say. 

People who think the United States has a clearly defined "carrying capacity" usually choose not to suggest a hard number. That should come as 
no surprise: calculating a carrying capacity would (a) require "showing one's work" and opening one's assumptions and methods to scrutiny, and  
(b) make one vulnerable to disproof by observation. Heck, Garrett Hardin himself spells out his reticence [Cite the page].

Edward Hartman confidently gave a carrying capacity of "100 to 200 million" back in the 200s. Following the lifeboat analogy, this would mean that the United State's lifeboat
capsized sometime in the 1960s (funny that we didn't notice). 


## 2. A lifeboat has a capsize mechanic. A nation does not.

What makes the lifeboat analogy such a good yarn is it's promise of quick, swift collapse. Overload the boat, and once the rim of the boat dips enough to allow water
to pour in, then instantly it becomes impossible to stop the viscious cycle, and before any reaction can take place, the entire boat capsizes. There are lots of other things that
have this 'capsize mechanic'. A bridge getting overloaded with weight. A dominoe run, collapsed with a single errant push. 

Scary stuff, no?

But it turns out that most things in life don't have a capsize mechanic. Your garden can't hold an infinite number of carrots,
but that doesn't mean that there's a set point where, once one-too-many carrots are planted, your entire garden suddenly upends, kills every plant, 
swallows your house. My milk carton has a very clear, set carrying capacity for milk, but that doesn't mean that once I've reached
that capacity, the entire carton is immediately destroyed, along with any of the milk that had started in the carton. My hard-drive can only store
500 GB, but if I try to copy more of that in, it doesn't delete all my files and then melt into scrap metal.

For just about everything in life, if something is filled close to the "carrying capacity", there are natural balancing mechanics that prevent
more from coming in. Maybe it becomes progressively harder to fit more things into your backpack.

So, do we see these feedback mechanics with respect to migration? Of course we do. If there are fewer job opportunities available in a state,
people are less likely to move there. If housing is exorbitantly expensive in your neighborhood, people are less likely to buy them.
Left to their own devices, people will naturally move to where there is work available and housing they can afford. People are not like
torrents of water pouring into a lifeboat.

## 3. A lifeboat collapse results in everyone on board ending up equally destitute.  An economic collapse does not.

  Central to the lifeboat metaphor is the claim that, once a nation reaches its population carrying capacity and the capsize event happens, everyone 
involved in the metaphor, newcomer and native alike, are reduced to the same state of utter desolation.

Economies, societies, and political collapses do not work this way, and they never have. No, not even in popular examples like the Fall of Rome, or 
the Bronze Age Collapse. When countries (or cities, or states) experience economic disasters, the wealthy  still overwhelmingly maintain an inordinate
amount of power and influence. They are often able to wether the economic storm. Hardin's metaphor would have us look at examples
like the 2008 housing crisis and assume that they would lead to literally everyone in the United States being reduced to the same income level.
Imagining economic hardships is this way is a simple rejection of how the real world works.

## 4. In the metaphor, every survivor contributes nothing to the bouyancy of the lifeboat, and provide no resources. But in a national economy, 
workers are valuable sources of resources.

The lifeboat metaphor imagines that almost everybody in a rich nation is a straightforward drain on resources. In my experience,
this is a typical assumption from writers who are concerned about overpopulation. All people, citizen and immigrant alike,
are merely eating through reserves (or 'weighing down the boat'), and do nothing to help the lifeboat. Interestingly,
I find that this is often how these writers envision themselves: they believe that they are consuming a finite store of 
resources that were stored away by their distant ancestors.
  But countries, economies, and polities don't work like that. A country explicitly benefits from its citizens,
either in the form of taxes they pay, or in the labor they provide, or even simply in the children they raise (this is why 
housewives are not simple 'leeches' on the nation, even though they don't make a paycheck). Low-skill immigrants
do not pay much in taxes, but they are clear net resource gains when it comes to their labor, and to raising children.
Put into fisc8al terms, the effect of the average low-skill immigrant is a net positive, once you take into
account the effects of their children.

## Step Three: Prove the Relevance

Any of the four differences I've given here would be enough to discount the lifeboat metaphor, but taken
together, they make it a complete non-starter. To prove that these are "distinctions with a difference",
it's time for me to put my claims to the test, and say I would agree with the metaphor if the distinctions were
resolved.

So let's imagine a situation where the metaphor was apt, by adding on each of the listed distinctions.
Suppose the United States had a clearly defined carrying capacity (let's say, down to the nearest 10 million), 
a clear, measurable, defensible population size beyond which it could no longer function as a nation-state.
This carrying capacity would need to be as measurable and confirmable as that of a lifeboat (whose carrying capacity
is a matter of high-school physics). For the sake of example, let's suppose that carrying capacity is 500 million.
  Next, let's add on a capsize mechanic, some kind of feedback mechanism where once the U.S. population breaches 500 million,
it's catastrophic ruin is immediate and irreversible. It strains the imagination to think what this capsize
mechanic could be, but for our purposes, let us assume that the United States has made a deal with an extraterrestial race,
who keeps a close eye on the population size, and will immediately attack the U.S. with overwhelming technological advantage
should the 'tipping point' be hit.
  Next, let's add in the 'equal destitution' distinction: the extraterrestial race will make a point of reducing each
and every inhabitant of the U.S. to the state of a low-skill immigrant. They will reduce all bank accounts to only
a few thousand dollars each, crumble all infrastructure until it resembles that of a third-world nation, and use mind-wiping
technology to remove all skills from the population.
   Finally, let's add in the fourth distinction, and assume that no immigrant ever works, pays taxes, raises a family,
or performs any service that is of any use to the nation. As far as our example is concerned, immigrants simply show up,
camp out by the side of the road, and recieve handouts. (This is, incidentally, how restrictionists sometimes portray immigrants.)

In this scenario, would I agree that the lifeboat metaphor is apt? Yes, I certainly would. Fearfully, looking over my shoulder at our
alien overlords, I would whole-heartedly endorse restricting immigration (assuming the United States was approaching its 'tipping point'). 
In this situation, the utilitarian calculus is clear, and Hardin would be right. As Hardin himself says:
"This last solution is abhorrent to many people. It is unjust, they say. Let us grant that it is."

### The Better Analogy: America, the Island

What happens if we make the analogy fit reality a little better?

First, let's change the metaphor to better match reality. America, as a nation, has no "capsize mechanic", and no defined carrying 
capacity, so a better example of America would be not a lifeboat, but an island. If restrictionists were to propose that America was
like an island, violently preventing desparate shipwreck survivors from reaching its shores, I would agree much more 
strongly with the metaphor. Notice that this refitting even allows (for the sake of argument) the restrictionist narrative
that every survivor is a net drain on resources. Restrictionists may imagine themselves as castaways on an island with only a few
palm trees worth of food. Should they make such a silly analogy, I'm happy to respond to it in a different blog post.

Now let's adjust the analogy the other way: let us imagine that reality were more like the lifeboat analogy. First, we would need to 
imagine that the U.S. has some defined carrying capacity: let's say a supersmart governmental department of geniuses decides that 
America's capacity is exactly 360 million. Next, we would need a capsize mechanic: the nature of the carrying capacity would 
need to gaurantee the swift and complete destruction of all American infrastructure once the population hits 360 Million. 
According to the analogy, this disaster would need to put all American residents in the same situtaion as the 'survivor' immigrants:
i.e., it would need to make jobless, homeless, poor, and without marketable skills. It's such a bizarre requirement of the catastrophe
that for simplicity sakes, we would need to imagine an angry god, capable of quickly destroying all of America's wealth, infrastructure,
housing, and even mental skills. Very well then: let us imagine a super-powered vengeful Anubis, carefully keeping track of
population count, ready to strike with his magic should the threshold ever be reached. He would crush America's highways and powerlines
(to the level of a third-world country), cause universal earthquakes to reduce all apartment buildings to shambles, wipe every
financial electronic record, and use his magic to make every American forget any post-high school education.

It's a 



The United States is the richest and most powerful nation in human history. Merely adding people to it in no way threatens any
capsize mechanic that we see.
