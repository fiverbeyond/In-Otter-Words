# A Bouquet of Bad Metaphors #3 : Why the Lifeboat Analogy Fails
## Allowing more immigration is not like letting a lifeboat get swamped.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In a previous blog post, I introduced the Lifeboat Analogy and gave some examples to suggest it's 
a poor analogy. In this post, I give it a straight disection and explain where the analogy fails.

For those of you just joining in, this is the second part of an analysis of the Lifeboat Analogy, Garret Hardin's popular metaphor
for immigration that suggests the United States is like a lifeboat on the verge of capsizing, and that its inhabitants
would be justified in rejecting any immigration, even by violent means. The justification lies in the claim
that, if too many 'survivors' climb onto the lifeboat, the boat will swamp and capsize, dooming everyone in it to the
same, terrible fate.

So let's clarify why this is bunk.

## How I Like to Dissolve an Analogy

Some of you may remember my [cite] preferred method for dissolving an analogy. To refresh, the basic steps are:

1) Clarify the parts of the analogy.
2) Point out the relevant differences between the analogy and reality.
3) Prove the relevance of the differences by saying that if these distinctions were resolved, I would agree with the analogy.

## Step One: Clarifying the Lifeboat Analogy


I think the Lifeboat Metaphor relies heavily on some implied assumptions that Hardin doesn't expose. Here are the ones ore relevant to understanding
why it fails:

1) The capsize mechanic ends in everyone involved being reduced to that of swimming survivors.

This assumption is at the heart of the metaphor's appeal to Utilitarianism (which is surprising in and of itself, considering that Hardin explicitly rejects
utilitarianism). The disaster proposed by the lifeboat metaphor isn't just that some in-boat survivors may be endangered: it's that absolutely
everyone involved in the situation will be reduced to a similar state of ruin. The in-water survivors will have gained nothing (they're still 
swimming in the ocean) and the in-boat survivors will all be swimming in the ocean as well.

  The utilitarian calculation here is straightforward: repelling the incoming swimmers may result in a few dozen lives saved (or whatever the 
capacity of the lifeboat is)... but allowing swimmers to approach the lifeboat will end in the worst possible outcome. 

1) The capsize mechanic is fast.

2) The capsize mechanic is irreversible.






## Step Two: Identifying the Relevant Differences

## 1. A lifeboat has a defined carrying capacity.  A nation does not.

The bouyancy forces that stop a lifeboat's rim from dipping underwater are a matter of high school physics. Given a description of the boat's mass and volume, you can 
calculate how much weight it can carry before the rim no longer keeps the water out.

Nations (and states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, etc) don't work like that, despite what "overpopulationists" may say. 

People who think the United States has a clearly defined "carrying capacity" usually choose not to suggest a hard number. That should come as 
no surprise: calculating a carrying capacity would (a) require "showing one's work" and opening one's assumptions and methods to scrutiny, and  
(b) make one vulnerable to disproof by observation. Heck, Garrett Hardin himself spells out his reticence [Cite the page].

Edward Hartman confidently gave a carrying capacity of "100 to 200 million" back in the 200s. Following the lifeboat analogy, this would mean that the United State's lifeboat
capsized sometime in the 1960s (funny that we didn't notice). 


## 2. A lifeboat has a capsize mechanic. A nation does not.

What makes the lifeboat analogy such a good yarn is it's promise of quick, swift collapse. Overload the boat, and once the rim of the boat dips enough to allow water
to pour in, then instantly it becomes impossible to stop the viscious cycle, and before any reaction can take place, the entire boat capsizes. There are lots of other things that
have this 'capsize mechanic'. A bridge getting overloaded with weight. A dominoe run, collapsed with a single errant push. 

Scary stuff, no?

But it turns out that most things in life don't have a capsize mechanic. Your garden can't hold an infinite number of carrots,
but that doesn't mean that there's a set point where, once one-too-many carrots are planted, your entire garden suddenly upends, kills every plant, 
swallows your house. My milk carton has a very clear, set carrying capacity for milk, but that doesn't mean that once I've reached
that capacity, the entire carton is immediately destroyed, along with any of the milk that had started in the carton. My hard-drive can only store
500 GB, but if I try to copy more of that in, it doesn't delete all my files and then melt into scrap metal.

For just about everything in life, if something is filled close to the "carrying capacity", there are natural balancing mechanics.
Maybe it becomes progressively harder to fit more things into your backpack.

So, do we see these feedback mechanics with respect to migration? Of course we do. If there are fewer job opportunities available in a state,
people are less likely to move there. If housing is exorbitantly expensive in your neighborhood, people are less likely to buy them.
Left to their own devices, people will naturally move to where there is work available and housing they can afford. People are not like
torrents of water pouring into a lifeboat.

## 3. A lifeboat collapse results in everyone on board ending up equally destitute.  An economic collapse does not.

## Step Three: Prove the Relevance

# The Better Analogy: America, the Island

What happens if we make the analogy fit reality a little better?

First, let's change the metaphor to better match reality. America, as a nation, has no "capsize mechanic", and no defined carrying 
capacity, so a better example of America would be not a lifeboat, but an island. If restrictionists were to propose that America was
like an island, violently preventing desparate shipwreck survivors from reaching its shores, I would agree much more 
strongly with the metaphor. Notice that this refitting even allows (for the sake of argument) the restrictionist narrative
that every survivor is a net drain on resources. Restrictionists may imagine themselves as castaways on an island with only a few
palm trees worth of food. Should they make such a silly analogy, I'm happy to respond to it in a different blog post.

Now let's adjust the analogy the other way: let us imagine that reality were more like the lifeboat analogy. First, we would need to 
imagine that the U.S. has some defined carrying capacity: let's say a supersmart governmental department of geniuses decides that 
America's capacity is exactly 360 million. Next, we would need a capsize mechanic: the nature of the carrying capacity would 
need to gaurantee the swift and complete destruction of all American infrastructure once the population hits 360 Million. 
According to the analogy, this disaster would need to put all American residents in the same situtaion as the 'survivor' immigrants:
i.e., it would need to make jobless, homeless, poor, and without marketable skills. It's such a bizarre requirement of the catastrophe
that for simplicity sakes, we would need to imagine an angry god, capable of quickly destroying all of America's wealth, infrastructure,
housing, and even mental skills. Very well then: let us imagine a super-powered vengeful Anubis, carefully keeping track of
population count, ready to strike with his magic should the threshold ever be reached. He would crush America's highways and powerlines
(to the level of a third-world country), cause universal earthquakes to reduce all apartment buildings to shambles, wipe every
financial electronic record, and use his magic to make every American forget any post-high school education.

It's a 



The United States is the richest and most powerful nation in human history. Merely adding people to it in no way threatens any
capsize mechanic that we see.
