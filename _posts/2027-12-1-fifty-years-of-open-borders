# Fifty Years of Open Borders
## Festrictionists say the U.S. has had open borders since before most of us were born.

>**_The Short Stuff:_** This is because the restrictionist understanding of what that phrase means is completely detached from an useful definition.


2023 - (Owens, Kirk, Rubin) The border with Mexico is currently open.
2023 - (Will Witt) For all practical purposes, our borders are open.

2006 - (Simcox) "There has never been a conscientious attempt to enforce immigration laws."

2006 - (Pat Buchanan) Republicans have supported open borders for decades.

2004 - ("Illegals" by John Dougherty) We currently have "open borders".

1984 - ("Fighting Immigration Anarchy") "We have lost control of our borders."

1981 - ("Firing line with William Buckley") "He have lost control of our borders."
