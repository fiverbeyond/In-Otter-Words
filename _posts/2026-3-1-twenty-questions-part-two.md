# Answering Twenty Questions: Part Two
## My responses to a list of restrictionist questions (numbers

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In their book, "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Immigration",
authors Johnh Zmirak and Al Perrotta list twenty questions for their readers to ask "in all sincerity".
These are my responses.




### `11) Even if you want to take in “the huddled masses yearning to breathe free”, don’t you at least want to screen them for communicable diseases first?`

Usually no, but it does depend on the severity of the disease. I don't think it's worth anybody's time to screen people for the flu or the common cold, for example, and 
I don't think the Covid border screening was useful. It's important to point out that this question has almost nothing to do with immigration: if 
a disease were so potent that it justified border screenings, then those screenings would need to be done to everyone crossing the border.
Immigration makes up less than 1% of border crossings. The rest comes from tourism, businesses, trade, and of course, American citizens.

In my experience, restrictionists suddenly become uninterested in border screenings when they are applied to American citizens.

### `12) How many more supporters of Sharia law does America need?`

America doesn't "need" any amount of any particular religion. Instead, in America, individuals decide for themselves what religion they'll follow.
It's a dramatic overreach of government to try to shape the population to follow one particular religion or another. After all, a government
with the power to say a foreigner's religion is bad, also has the power to say *your* religion is bad.

### `13) Would you rather your tax dollars go to an illegal immigrant or to help millions more Americans afford health insurance?`

Wow... either help one unauthorized immigrant, or 'millions' of Americans?
You got me there; I'll lose my Utilitarian Club membership card if I don't choose the millions.

### `14) Would you rather your education tax dollars go to illegals or toward building new schools?"

These aren't mutually exclusive: presumably if my tax dollars go toward building new schools, some unauthorized immigrants will
attend those schools. Likewise, if my tax dollars go to educating unauthorized immigrants, some of that money will be used to build 
new schools.

Let me cut to the chase on what I think this question is 'really asking', namely whether I'd rather my tax money go to educate unauthorized immigrants,
or citizens, or authorized immigrants. My easy answer is that I have absolutely no preference. All money spent on educating children is paid back threefold to the U.S.(because
those children go on to become high-skill workers, and build a highly-educated society). This is true regardless of the child's immigration status.
Restrictionists who work to stop these immigrant children from being educated are pushing for a poorer America.

### `15) Even if you are fine with Dreamers staying in the United States, should they get to sponsor countless other immigrants such as their parents, who snuck them in illegally?`

"Countless"? Naw, I'm fine with the current legal limit, (which is in the 90s). 
Restrictionists often say that family unification (or "chain migration", as they like to say) typically results
in dozens of immigrants being 'chained' from a single legal immigrant. This is false. The average family unification
group is less than four. [https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Chain-Migration-and-Why-It-Matters](https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Chain-Migration-and-Why-It-Matters)


### `16) What’s wrong with an American immigration policy based on what’s best for America?`

A policy based *only* on what's best for America ignores the inherent worth of other human beings. For example, 
such a policy would justify the U.S. invading Mexico, driving out the population, and stealing their resources. Most restrictionists understand that this would be wrong, 
but it's hard to say why this would be
if the one and only consideration guiding policy is "Does it benefit America?"

### `17) Ronald Reagan famously said “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” Where is he wrong and why?'

He's wrong as a simple fact of both history and the modern day. America was founded with open borders.
It often had borders that literally no government representative had even seen, let alone set up strict operational control.
By Reagan's definition here, America wasn't a nation until well after the Civil War.

But it's worse than that. Modern day examples like the Shengen Area certainly qualify as "open borders" to restrictionists.
By Reagan's definition, this would mean that Germany, France, Switzerland, and the other 20-odd Schengen Area members
haven't been countries since "Toy Story" came out.

But it's even worse than that. Since 1980, popular restrictionist organizations have said over and over again that the United States
did not control its own borders (although admittedly, they sometimes would say that the borders were controlled during the Trump administration).
By Reagan's definition, this would mean that the U.S. hasn't been a nation since before I was born.

This seems pretty silly.

### `18) Do you still believe in the American Dream? Do you think it was built on welfare programs and balkanized ethnic ghettos?`

Yes, I still believe in the American Dream.

And yes, the American Dream was *absolutely* built on "welfare programs" and "balkanized ethnic ghettos". It was built
by dirt poor Irishmen and wealthy industrialists. It was built by religious enclaves, penal colonies, farmer philosophers, 
passionate entrepreneurs, and misanthrope poets.

It was built by all of us, rich and poor, immigrant and native. And those who try to cut out *any* of these groups
that built America are themselves deeply unamerican. 

### `19) Isn’t American immigration worth doing right, both for the immigrant and America?`

Absolutely! Obviously a policy that benefits only one and not the other would be a bad idea. Right?

### `20) How do you form newcomers into great Americans if you keep insisting that America isn’t all that great, anyway?`

I think America is pretty dang great.
