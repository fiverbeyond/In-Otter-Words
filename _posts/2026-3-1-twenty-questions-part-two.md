 # Answering Twenty Questions: Part Two
## My responses to a list of restrictionist questions (numbers

>**_The Short Stuff:_** In their book, "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Immigration",
authors Johnh Zmirak and Al Perrotta list twenty questions for their readers to ask "in all sincerity".
These are my responses.




### `11) Even if you want to take in “the huddled masses yearning to breathe free”, don’t you at least want to screen them for communicable diseases first?`

Usually no, but it admittedly depends on the severity of the disease. I don't think it's worth anybody's time to screen people for the flu or the common cold, for example, and 
I don't think the Title 42 Covid border restrictions were useful.[^title-forty-two]. However, it is conceivable that a particularly deadly pandemic would justify medical border screenings. 

It's important to point out that this question has almost nothing to do with immigration: if 
a disease were so potent that it justified border screenings, then those screenings would need to be done to everyone crossing the border. Immigration makes up less than 1% of border crossings[^one-percent]. The rest comes from tourism, businesses, trade, and of course, American citizens.

In my experience, restrictionists suddenly become uninterested in border screenings when they are applied to American citizens.

### `12) How many more supporters of Sharia law does America need?`

America doesn't "need" any amount of any particular religion. Instead, in America, individuals decide for themselves what religion they'll follow.

This is an important point where I differ from Mr. Zmirak and Mr. Perotta. In their eyes, the mix of religions within the United States should be chosen by government officials, who decide how much of each religion is "needed" (how many Catholics are "needed", how many Baptists are "needed", etc). In my eyes, Congress should make no law respecting an establishment of religion. 

I would humbly suggest that my approach is more American.

### 13) "Would you rather your tax dollars go to an illegal immigrant or to help millions more Americans afford health insurance?`

Wow... either help one unauthorized immigrant, or 'millions' of Americans?
You got me there; I'll lose my Utilitarian Club membership card if I don't choose the millions.

### 14) "Would you rather your education tax dollars go to illegals or toward building new schools?"

These aren't mutually exclusive: presumably if my tax dollars go toward building new schools, some unauthorized immigrants will
attend those schools. Likewise, if my tax dollars go to educating unauthorized immigrants, some of that money will be used to build new schools.

Let me cut to the chase on what I think this question is 'really' asking, namely whether I'd rather my tax money go to educate unauthorized immigrants,
or citizens, or authorized immigrants. My easy answer is that I have absolutely no preference. All money spent on educating children is paid back threefold to the U.S.(because
those children go on to become high-skill workers, and build a highly-educated society). [Cite this statistic] This is true regardless of the child's immigration status. Restrictionists who work to stop these immigrant children from being educated are pushing for a poorer America.

### `15) Even if you are fine with Dreamers staying in the United States, should they get to sponsor countless other immigrants such as their parents, who snuck them in illegally?`

"Countless"? Naw, I'm fine with the current legal limit, (which is in the 90s). 
Restrictionists often say that family unification (or "chain migration", as they like to say) typically results
in dozens of immigrants being 'chained' into the country from a single legal immigrant. This is false. The average family unification
group is less than four.[^chain-size] 


### `16) What’s wrong with an American immigration policy based on what’s best for America?`

A policy based *only* on what's best for America ignores the inherent worth of other human beings, and is a rejection of American values. For example, 
such a policy would justify the U.S. invading Canada, driving out the population, and stealing their resources. Most restrictionists understand that this would be wrong, 
but it's hard to say why this would be
if the one and only consideration guiding policy is "Does it benefit America?"

### `17) Ronald Reagan famously said “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” Where is he wrong and why?'

He's wrong as a simple fact of both history and the modern day. America was founded with open borders.
It often had borders that literally no government representative had even seen, let alone set up strict operational control over. By Reagan's definition here, America wasn't a nation until well after the Civil War.

But it's worse than that. Modern day examples like the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area) certainly qualify as "open borders" to restrictionists.
By Reagan's definition, this would mean that Germany, France, Switzerland, and the other 20-odd Schengen Area members
haven't been countries since "Toy Story" came out.

But it's *even* worse than that. Since 1980, popular restrictionist organizations have said over and over again that the United States
already[^prager] had[^dougherty] open[^buchanan] borders (although admittedly, they sometimes say the borders have been under control since January 2025).
Under Reagan's definition, this would mean that the U.S. hasn't been a nation since before I was born.

Such a definiton of nationhood is silly and meaningless, and it has nothing to do with the definitions of nationhood used by people who talk seriously about what a nation is.

### `18) Do you still believe in the American Dream? Do you think it was built on welfare programs and balkanized ethnic ghettos?`

Yes, I still believe in the American Dream.

And yes, the American Dream was *absolutely* built on "welfare programs" and "balkanized ethnic ghettos". It was built
by dirt poor Irishmen and wealthy industrialists. It was built by religious enclaves, penal colonies, farmer philosophers, 
passionate entrepreneurs, and misanthrope poets.

It was built by all of us, rich and poor, immigrant and native. Those who try to cut out *any* of these groups
that built America are themselves deeply un-American. 

### `19) Isn’t American immigration worth doing right, both for the immigrant and America?`

Absolutely! Obviously a policy that benefits only one and not the other would be a bad idea. Right?

### `20) How do you form newcomers into great Americans if you keep insisting that America isn’t all that great, anyway?`

I think America is pretty dang great.

[^title-forty-two]: [This report](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-title-42-expulsion-policy-does-nothing-to-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/) from the Center for American Progress
suggests that Title 42 did pretty much nothing to slow the spread of Covid. Even [when restrictionists organizations talk about Title 42](https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Coming-End-Title-42), they don't even mention the efficacy of the policy as a means 
of slowing Covid.

[^one-percent]:
Even fiddling around with [publicly available databases](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/explore/query/SELECT%20sum%28%60value%60%29%0AWHERE%0A%20%20%60date%60%0A%20%20%20%20BETWEEN%20%222024-12-05T22%3A51%3A46%22%20%3A%3A%20floating_timestamp%0A%20%20%20%20AND%20%222025-12-05T22%3A51%3A46%22%20%3A%3A%20floating_timestamp%0A%20%20AND%20caseless_one_of%28%60measure%60%2C%20%22Personal%20Vehicle%20Passengers%22%29/page/aggregate) will show
you that several hundred million people cross the land border into the U.S. each year. These are typically U.S. citizens travelling, or business workers who live close to the border. 
Even with high estimates for the number of illegal border crossings (several hundred thousand), illegal immigration makes up a miniscule percentage of the border crossings that happen each year.

[^prager]:"Under democratic influence since Ted Kennedy… the border has been essentially open to millions of people to come into this country illegally.”
